[Terraform][terraform] is an infrastructure as code tool that allows you to deploy infrastructure programmatically.

The [Tailscale Terraform provider][terraform-provider-registry] is maintained and published in the Terraform registry by Tailscale.

### Features

Use the Terraform provider for Tailscale to:

- Define your [tailnet policy file][acls], using the [`tailscale_acl` resource][acl-resource]
- Set [DNS settings][dns], including:
  - global nameservers, using the [`tailscale_dns_nameservers` resource][dns-nameservers-resource]
  - restricted nameservers for split DNS, using the [`tailscale_dns_search_paths` resource][dns-search-paths-resource]
  - enabling or disabling [MagicDNS][magicdns], using the
    [`tailscale_dns_preferences` resource][dns-preferences-resource]
- Generate an [auth key][auth-key], including setting whether itâ€™s reusable, ephemeral, pre-authorized, and tagged,
  using the [`tailscale_key` resource][key-resource]
- Manage properties of a device, including:
  - approving the device, using the [`tailscale_device_authorization` resource][device-authorization-resource]
  - disabling key expiry, using the [`tailscale_device_key` resource][device-key-resource]
  - setting tags, using the [`tailscale_device_tags` resource][device-tags-resource]
  - advertising subnet routes, using the [`tailscale_device_subnet_routes` resource][device-subnet-routes-resource]

### Installation steps

To use Terraform with Tailscale, configure the
[Tailscale Terraform provider][terraform-provider-registry] with an API access token for Tailscale, and with the name
of your tailnet. These can be configured either as part of your Terraform configuration, or as environment variables in Terraform.

<Note>
  It is not recommended to store sensitive information such as an API access token in source
  control. Instead, use an environment variable.
</Note>

```json
terraform {
  required_providers {
    tailscale = {
      source = "tailscale/tailscale"
      version = "<version>"
    }
  }
}

provider "tailscale" {
  // Not recommended to store API access tokens in source control
  // Instead, store this as an environment variable TAILSCALE_API_KEY
  api_key = "tskey-1234567CNTRL-abcdefghijklmnopqrstu"
  tailnet = "example.com"
}
```

#### Environment variables

Instead of specifying Tailscale provider information in your Terraform configuration file, you can store this information as environment variables in Terraform:

- `TAILSCALE_API_KEY` for the Tailscale API access token
- `TAILSCALE_TAILNET` for the tailnet name

### Migrating from the community-contributed Terraform provider

If you previously used the community-contributed Terraform provider, and now want to use the provider
managed and published by Tailscale, update the `source` argument in your Terraform configuration. That is, update
`source = "davidsbond/tailscale"` to `source = "tailscale/tailscale"`.

### Special thanks

Special thanks to [David Bond][david-bond], who contributed and maintained the original community-contributed Tailscale Terraform provider. Tailscale now maintains and publishes this provider.
