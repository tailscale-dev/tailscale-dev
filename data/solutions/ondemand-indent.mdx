[Indent][indent] is a way to get just-in-time access to your Tailscale resources, with Indent handling on-demand
requests, including request approval workflows.

On-demand access to Tailscale resources such as cloud apps and infrastructure can be provisioned using Indent.
This works by adding and removing members from Tailscale [groups][groups].

### Prerequisites

Before you begin this guide, you’ll need a tailnet with at least one device and an Indent space.

- For information about creating a tailnet, see the [Tailscale quickstart][tailscale-quickstart].

- For information about creating an Indent space, see the [Indent quickstart][indent-quickstart].

### Integration

For the full set of instructions, see Indent’s documentation for [setting up a Tailscale webhook integration][indent-deploy]. To use Indent with Tailscale resources, you’ll need to:

1. Set up Indent’s integration for Tailscale. This requires cloning a GitHub action and using Terraform to deploy changes to Indent.
   1. Generate a Tailscale [API access token][access-token] from the [keys page][keys-page] of the admin console, and set it as the GitHub secret `TAILSCALE_API_KEY`.
   1. Set your tailnet’s organization as the GitHub secret `TAILSCALE_TAILNET`. For example, `example.com`, `myemail@example.com`, `example.github`,
      `example.org.github`, etc. You can find your organization in the [Settings][settings] page of the admin console.
1. Sync Tailscale groups you want to use for access control to Indent. In the [Resources page][indent-resources] of the Indent dashboard, click **Pull from Integrations** to obtain Tailscale groups.

### Example configuration

When configuring Tailscale to work with Indent, you will need to set up groups that Indent can add users to and
remove users from as their access is granted or revoked.

Use [ACL tags][acl-tags] when adding servers to your Tailscale network, so that their access is based on their
purpose. Then, you can allow [groups][groups] to have access to certain tags in Tailscale ACLs. You can also make a
group a [tag owner][tag-owner] if they should be able to manage tagged devices.

For example, if you want the SRE team `group:sre-prod` to be able to SSH into production servers with `tag:prod`,
you can set up a configuration like:

```json
{
  "groups": {
    "group:sre-prod": ["alice@example.com", "bob@example.com"],
  },
  "acls": [
    {
      "action": "accept",
      "src": ["group:sre-prod"],
      "dst": ["tag:prod:*"]
    },
  ],
  "ssh": [
    {
      "action": "accept",
      "src": ["group:sre-prod"],
      "dst": ["tag:prod"],
      "users": ["ubuntu", "root"]
    },
  ]
  "tagOwners": {
    "tag:prod": ["group:sre-prod"]
  }
}
```

Now when an SRE needs to access production, they can use the `/access` command for Indent in Slack, or go to [access.new][access-new], to request temporary access to SSH into production.
