Amazon's Relational Database Service (AWS RDS) provides a managed relational
database accessible using SQL and other methods. RDS is an Amazon-managed service
reached via an internal IP address. To make RDS accessible to a tailnet, we use a
[subnet router](/kb/1019/subnets/).

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin this guide, you'll need a Tailscale network set up and
configured with at least one existing device. Read our [getting started guide](/kb/1017/install)
if you need help with this.

Setting up the RDS instance itself won't be covered here, we'll assume that RDS is
already in use. There are a number of different database engines available with RDS,
from Amazon's own Aurora, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and more. The connectivity techniques
described here works with all of them.

For purposes of this article, let's assume the RDS is set up in the `us-west-2` region.

#### Step 1: Set up a subnet router

First, [create an EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/gs-step-one-create-ec2-resources.html)
running Amazon Linux on either x86 or ARM. Tailscale produces Linux packages containing binaries
for both architectures, and the AWS ARM instances are very cost effective.

Some AWS Regions have multiple datacenters, each with an associated Availability Zone and
a subnet of IP addresses. RDS instances in a Region are reachable from all of these subnets,
so the EC2 instance can be created on any of them. Other AWS managed services may require
connecting to a specific subnet.

If at least one side of a tunnel has "easy NAT," where Tailscale can determine the UDP port
number on the far side of the NAT device, then it will make
[direct connections to minimize latency](/blog/how-tailscale-works/).
When setting the security policy, allow UDP port 41641 to ingress from any source. This will enable
[direct connections](/kb/1082/firewall-ports/), to minimize latency.

Then ssh to the system and follow the steps to
[install Tailscale on Amazon Linux](/kb/1052/install-amazon-linux-2/)
and [configure subnet routing](/kb/1019/subnets/).
When running `tailscale up`, pass your VPC subnet to `--advertise-routes`.
For example, if the subnet address range is `172.31.0.0/16`, the command would be:

```
tailscale up --advertise-routes=172.31.0.0/16 --accept-dns=false
```

<Note>
  For EC2 instances it is generally best to let Amazon handle the DNS configuration, not have
  Tailscale override it, so we added `--accept-dns=false`.
</Note>

<Note>
  The Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, etc clients all accept advertised routes by default, but Linux
  clients need to use `tailscale up --accept-routes=true` to use the routes being advertised by the
  subnet router in AWS.
</Note>

#### Step 2: Configure RDS security policy

We need the RDS security policy to allow connection from the subnet router.
The RDS security policy can be found in the instance details of the RDS instance.
We add the security policy created for the EC2 subnet router instance.

#### Step 3: Add AWS DNS for your tailnet

For the benefit of the _other_ nodes in the tailnet we'll set up
[split DNS](/kb/1054/dns/#using-dns-settings-in-the-admin-panel) to allow
use of the same DNS names as are used inside of AWS.

The AWS DNS server address [is always the base of the VPC subnet + 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html#AmazonDNS).
For example, if the subnet is `172.31.0.0`, the DNS server will be `172.31.0.2`. In the [admin console DNS section](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns) this can be added as a nameserver restricted to the region-specific `compute.internal` domain, for example, `us-west-2.compute.internal`.

  className="bordered"
  alt="Adding a split DNS resolver for us-west-2.compute.internal"

/>

#### Step 4: Remove public SSH access

As we can now ssh to the system over the private Tailscale network, there is no reason to leave
the SSH port open on a public IP address. In the security group for the EC2 instance, delete the
SSH rule allowing inbound connections.

#### Step 5: Connect to RDS

We can now connect to RDS from any node on the tailnet, using the same DNS name as is used inside AWS.

For example, to access your RDS server from your personal computer, while logged into your tailnet:

```sh
mysqlsh --uri=admin@database-2.0123456789ab.us-west-2.rds.compute.internal:3306
 MySQL  database-2.cqlh98u5sael.us-west-2.rds.compute.internal:3306 ssl  JS > \sql
Switching to SQL mode... Commands end with ;
MySQL  database-2.cqlh98u5sael.us-west-2.rds.compute.internal:3306 ssl  SQL > show databases;
+--------------------+

| performance_schema |
| sys                |
+--------------------+

```

Using a subnet router allows us to connect to many services within AWS, not just RDS, using their internal AWS IP address.
