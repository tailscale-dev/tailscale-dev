[Coder](https://coder.com/) is a developer workspace platform which allows you to develop code in a remote environment like a VM running in a cloud provider. In Coder, you define your developer workspace as a Dockerfile.

Tailscale can be installed within a Coder workspace to be able to access private
resources securely, such as package registries, or to share an environment with
your colleagues for code review or pair programming.

#### Integration

Follow [Coder's instructions for getting Tailscale working in a Coder workspace](https://coder.com/docs/coder/latest/guides/customization/tailscale). You'll need to:

1. Add `tailscaled` in your [workspace's Dockerfile](https://coder.com/docs/coder/latest/images/writing). You'll also need to ensure that Tailscale’s persistent state is stored in the workspace’s persistent home volume, so that Tailscale can persist connections across workspace rebuilds
1. Enable [userspace networking](/kb/1112/userspace-networking/), and if you want to be able to have outbound connections, configure Tailscale as either a SOCKS5 or HTTP proxy

#### Authorization

To allow the Coder workspace to join your tailnet, authenticate to Tailscale from your workspace using `sudo tailscale up`.
