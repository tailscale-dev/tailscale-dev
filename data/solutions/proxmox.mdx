Proxmox is a popular open-source solution for running virtual machines and containers,
built on top of a Debian Linux platform.

[Installing Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/kb/1031/install-linux/) allows the Proxmox
console to be accessed from anywhere, without needing to open firewall ports or manually
configure a VPN.

### Troubleshooting

#### Installing Tailscale within a VM

Proxmox can run virtual machines, emulating a hardware device and allowing an unmodified
operating system to run within it. [Tailscale can be installed](https://tailscale.com/kb/install/)
in the OS within the virtual machine as normal.

#### Installing Tailscale within an LXC

Proxmox can also run lightweight Linux containers called LXC/LXD and can run them privileged
or unprivileged. Tailscale can run within LXC/LXD containers, though running within an
unprivileged container [requires an adjustment in the config](https://tailscale.com/kb/1130/lxc-unprivileged/).

#### resolv.conf within LXC

By default Proxmox writes its own DNS config to /etc/resolv.conf within LXCs. Even if the LXC gets
its DNS configuration via DHCP, Proxmox will overwrite /etc/resolv.conf with its own.
If Tailscale is installed on Proxmox and using MagicDNS, Proxmox will write that config to
the container's /etc/resolv.conf:

```sh
# --- BEGIN PVE ---
nameserver 100.100.100.100
search example.ts.net
# --- END PVE ---
```

If the LXC itself does not have Tailscale installed, this configuration is unlikely to work and
DNS lookups will time out.

Two options to mitigate this behavior are:

- Configure tailscale without MagicDNS on the Proxmox host with `tailscale up --accept-dns=false`.
- Create a file named `/etc/.pve-ignore.resolv.conf` _within each LXC's filesystem_ that will tell
  Proxmox not to overwrite /etc/resolv.conf.
