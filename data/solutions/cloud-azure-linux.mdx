Microsoft Azure is a cloud service provider offering Linux and Windows virtual machines, to
which Tailscale can be used to provide secure connectivity. This Knowledge Base article
covers Linux VMs running within Azure. There is
[another KB article covering Windows VMs](/kb/1143/azure-windows).

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin this guide, you'll need a Tailscale network set up and
configured with at least one existing device. Read our [getting started guide](/kb/1017/install)
if you need help with this.

#### Step 1: Set up the Tailscale client for Linux VMs

First, [create a Virtual Machine in the Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Compute%2FVirtualMachines)
running Linux. Tailscale supports [many of the Linux distributions](/kb/1031/install-linux/)
offered by Azure Marketplace images.

If at least one side of a tunnel has "easy NAT," where Tailscale can determine the UDP port
number on the far side of the NAT device, then it will make
[direct connections to minimize latency.](/blog/how-tailscale-works/)
We ensure that the Azure nodes can make direct connections by allowing UDP port 41641 to
ingress through the firewall.

In the Networking step of setting up the VM, choose Advanced for the NIC network security group
and create a network security policy to allow UDP port 41641 to ingress.

Then ssh to the system and follow the steps to
[install Tailscale on Linux](/kb/1031/install-linux/).

#### Step 2: Advertise routes from the VM

For the benefit of the _other_ nodes in the tailnet we'll set up
[split DNS](/kb/1054/dns/#using-dns-settings-in-the-admin-panel) to allow
use of the same DNS names as are used inside of Azure. The
[Azure DNS server address is 168.63.129.16](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-name-resolution-for-vms-and-role-instances#azure-provided-name-resolution), which is an Anycasted address that will go
to the nearest DNS server within Azure.

We'll have our VM advertise routes for both the subnet it sits on as well as the Azure DNS
server. For example if the subnet address range is 10.1.0.0/24, the command would be:

```shell
tailscale up --advertise-routes=10.1.0.0/24,168.63.129.16/32 --accept-dns=false
```

<Note>
  For Azure VMs it is generally best to let Azure handle the DNS configuration, not have Tailscale
  override it, so we added `--accept-dns=false`.
</Note>

#### Step 3: Add Azure DNS for your tailnet

In the [admin console DNS section](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns) we add a nameserver
restricted to the `internal.cloudapp.net` domain, pointing to the Azure DNS server which we
made available through our VM.

/>

Now the same hostnames which work between nodes running within Azure will also be available
to all nodes on our tailnet.

#### Step 4: Remove public SSH access

As we can now ssh to the system over the private Tailscale network, there is no reason to leave
the SSH port open on a public IP address. In the Settings > Network tab click on the ingress
rule for "SSH" and delete it.
