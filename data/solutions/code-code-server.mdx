[code-server](https://github.com/cdr/code-server) is a way to run Visual Studio Code anywhere and access it in through a browser.

Tailscale can be installed within a code-server VM to be able to access private resources securely,
such as databases or continuous integration nodes or servers in the dev/test environment.

#### Integration

code-server is installed within a VM with [instructions for a number of hosting providers](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/blob/main/docs/install.md).

Tailscale can be [installed in VMs](https://tailscale.com/kb/1031/install-linux/)
for many common hosting providers like
[AWS](https://tailscale.com/kb/1021/install-aws/),
[Azure](https://tailscale.com/kb/1142/cloud-azure-linux/),
[Google Cloud](https://tailscale.com/kb/1147/cloud-gce/), and
[Hetzner](https://tailscale.com/kb/1150/cloud-hetzner/).

#### Authorization

The VM will need to be authorized to join the tailnet using either a browser to log in,
or an [one-time auth key](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/authkeys).
