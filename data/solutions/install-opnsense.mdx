[OPNsense](https://opnsense.org/) is an open source router and
firewall platform built using FreeBSD. Tailscale can be installed on
an OPNsense platform, joining it to your WireGuard-based mesh network.

OPNsense is a community supported platform for Tailscale. GitHub user
[@newmy-de](https://github.com/newmy-de) provided these instructions.

Perform the following steps as root:

```
# opnsense-code ports
# cd /usr/ports/security/tailscale
# make install
# service tailscaled enable
# service tailscaled start
# tailscale up
```

You'll be asked to authenticate to Tailscale in your browser.

Make sure to run `opnsense-code ports` again even if you have
done so previously, to update the ports tree to current versions. The
version of Tailscale in the FreeBSD ports is periodically updated for new releases.

Once started, Tailscale should appear in the list of interfaces in the
OPNsense UI. It can be used in firewall rules and other OPNsense
functions.

#### Direct Connections for LAN Clients

As a router/firewall, OPNsense may also be providing Internet connectivity for LAN
devices which themselves have a Tailscale client installed. The NAT implementation
in OPNsense is an
[Endpoint-Dependent Mapping, or "hard" NAT](/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/),
which means that LAN devices have difficulty making direct connections and often resort to
[DERP Relays](/kb/1232/derp-servers/). To learn how to make direct connections, see the
[OPNsense and pfSense](/kb/1181/firewalls/#opnsense-and-pfsense) section in our firewall article.

#### Further reading

Setting up [subnet routing](/kb/1019/subnets/) or acting as an [exit node](/kb/1103/exit-nodes/) may be of interest for a router using OPNsense.
