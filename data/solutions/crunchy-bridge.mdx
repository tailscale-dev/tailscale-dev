[Crunchy Bridge][crunchy-bridge] is a managed Postgres service run in major cloud provides such as
Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. It is built by the company
[Crunchy Data][crunchy-data]. Each Crunchy Bridge instance lives in its own virtual private cloud
(VPC). The Tailscale integration for Crunchy Bridge allows users to connect to their Crunchy Bridge
cluster securely for clouds where there are no VPCs, or directly where VPC peering doesn't make
sense, for example, for testing.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin this guide, you’ll need a tailnet and a Crunchy Bridge account.

- For information about creating a tailnet, see the [Tailscale quickstart][tailscale-quickstart].

- For information about creating a Crunchy Bridge account, see [Crunchy Bridge][crunchy-bridge].

### Integration

See the full instructions in Crunchy Data's [blog post][crunchy-blog-post] for setting up an
integration with Tailscale.

To use Crunchy Bridge with Tailscale, you'll need to:

1. Create an [auth key][auth-key]. You need to be an
   [Owner, Admin, or Network Admin][roles] of a tailnet in order to create an auth key.
   To create the key, open the [**Keys**][keys-page] page in the Tailscale admin console. We
   recommend using a tagged reusable pre-authorized key for this purpose. A [tagged][tagged] key
   restricts the Crunchy Bridge device’s permissions based on the [access control list][acls] rules
   for the tag that will apply as soon as the device is provisioned. A reusable key is useful in
   retry connection logic, and pre-authorized so that every new instance doesn't need to be authorized.

<Note>
  **Be very careful with reusable keys!** These can be very dangerous if stolen. They're best kept
  in a key vault product specially designed for the purpose.
</Note>

1. In the Crunchy Bridge dashboard for managing your cluster, click **Networking** and then click
   **Tailscale**. For **Auth Key**, paste in the auth key that you previously created.

1. Click **Connect Tailscale**.

1. Open the [**Machines**][machines] page of the Tailscale admin console. After the connection
   initializes, you should see the Crunchy Bridge cluster device in your tailnet. Copy the
   Tailscale IP address, which is in the form [`100.x.y.x` format][ip-address].

1. Use the Tailscale IP address when you connect to your Crunchy Bridge cluster. For example, if the
   Tailscale IP address is the `100.101.102.103` and you're using port `5432`:

   ```
   psql postgres://application:<your-application-id>@100.101.102.103:5432/postgres
   ```

### Limitations

- Auth keys expire after 90 days.
