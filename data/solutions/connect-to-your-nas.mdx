Tailscale makes it easy to securely connect to your
[Network-Attached
Storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage) (NAS)
devices over WireGuard&reg;. There are different levels of official or
community support depending on the platform.

In general, [install Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/kb/1031/install-linux)
on the NAS and follow the steps to authorize it.

Tailscale is completely free for most personal uses, including accessing
your NAS.

If you run into problems, email us at

FreeNAS is based on FreeBSD. Our users have reported that Tailscale's
FreeBSD version works fine on FreeNAS.
