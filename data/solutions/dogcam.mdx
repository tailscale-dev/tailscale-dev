Tailscale makes it easy to setup a dogcam that you can securely access from
anywhere.

Unlike an off-the-shelf dogcam, with Tailscale you don't need to trust
a third-party service, or risk exposing a camera inside your home to the public
internet. Every connection on Tailscale is encrypted and entirely private
to your network.

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin this guide, you'll need two things:

1. A Raspberry Pi with Wi-Fi/Ethernet capabilities (e.g. [Raspberry Pi 3 B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/))
1. A USB webcam (e.g. [Logitech C615](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0058LKJIO/))

This guide assumes your Raspberry Pi is already [set up with an internet connection](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md),
whether Wi-Fi or Ethernet.

You'll also need [a Tailscale account](https://login.tailscale.com/start). You can make
a free personal account using a @gmail.com address.

#### Step 1: Install Tailscale on your Raspberry Pi

You can find instructions at the link below.

<DownloadTailscale />

Once it is installed, and you've run `tailscale up` on your Raspberry Pi, continue to the next step.

#### Step 2: Install motion

Next, install [motion](https://motion-project.github.io) using apt with this command

```
sudo apt install motion
```

#### Step 3: Configure motion

First, we'll enable motion to run as a background service. Edit
`/etc/default/motion` using `nano` or your favorite editor:

```
sudo nano /etc/default/motion
```

We'll change the start_motion_daemon setting to "yes":

```
start_motion_daemon=yes
```

Save and close the file.

Next, we'll configure motion to expose a web page, and modify a few video
capture settings too.

Open up `/etc/motion/motion.conf` with your editor

```
sudo nano /etc/motion/motion.conf
```

Search for the following settings, updating their values to ones listed below.

_Enable viewing video streams over the web._ You can also change the port from the default value (8081) if you'd like.

```bash
stream_port 8081
stream_localhost off
```

_Disable saving images or video to the SD card._ Since this is a dogcam, we
only care about looking at live footage.

```bash
output_pictures off
ffmpeg_output_movies off
```

Save and close the file.

#### Step 4: Restart motion

Once all your configuration settings have been updated, restart motion

```
sudo service motion restart
```

#### Step 5: View your dogcam

From any device in your Tailscale network, you can now view the live webcam
stream from `<raspberry pi tailscale ip>:8081`. [Find your Raspberry Pi's IP](/kb/1033/ip-and-dns-addresses)
and type it into your browser.

  width={1000}
  height={535}
  alt="On macOS, you can click on the device name to copy the IP address."
/>

You should see a feed from your webcam, that will look something like
this:

<br />
<Image
  src="/images/solutions/dogcam/browser.jpg"
  width={1200}
  height={987}
  alt="Theo and Casey are looking at something that's totally not a Tailscalar running around in a backyard."
/>
Success! You now have a functioning dogcam, secured with Tailscale. This can only be accessed by
devices on your personal Tailscale network, and no one else.

<Note>
  Your browser may show an "insecure" warning, since your connection isn't over HTTPS. Tailscale
  secures your connection at a lower level, so rest easy knowing you are securely connected to any
  website at 100.x.y.z IP address.
</Note>

#### Next steps

Install Tailscale onto your [Android](/download/android) or [iOS](/download/ios)
device to check in on your dogs (or other pets) wherever you may be.

You may also want to experiment with other settings such as `width`, `height`,
or `framerate`. If you make other changes, be sure to restart motion
with `sudo service motion restart` afterwards.
