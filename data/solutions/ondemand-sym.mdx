[Sym][sym] is a security and access workflow platform that allows you to manage just-in-time access to your Tailscale resources.

On-demand access to Tailscale resources can be provisioned using Sym. This works by adding and removing members from [groups][groups] defined in Tailscale ACLs.

<Note>
  Sym will use a user’s Slack email address in Tailscale ACLs. If the user's Tailscale email is
  different from the email used by Slack, you will need to use the{' '}
  <a href="https://docs.symops.com/docs/manage-users#update-identity">symflow CLI</a> to manage the
  user identity.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin this guide, you’ll need a tailnet with at least one device and a Sym account.

- For information about creating a tailnet, see the [Tailscale quickstart][tailscale-quickstart].

- For information about creating a Sym account, see [Getting Started with Sym][sym-start].

### Integration

For the full set of instructions, see Sym's documentation for [setting up a Tailscale access target][sym-deploy]. To use Sym with Tailscale, you’ll need to:

1. Generate a Tailscale [API access token][access-token] from the [keys page][keys-page] of the admin console. Then, [share this API access token with the Sym Runtime][sym-secrets].
1. In Sym, define a `sym_integration` resource with `type = tailscale`.
   1. Set the `external_id` to your tailnet’s organization. For example, `example.com`, `myemail@example.com`, `example.github`,
      `example.org.github`, etc. You can find your organization in the [Settings][settings] page of the admin console.
   1. Set the `api_token_secret` to the `sym_secret` referencing your Tailscale API access token.
1. Define which groups you’d like to manage access to in Tailscale. In Sym, define a `sym_target`
   resource with `type = tailscale_group`, and specify the `group_name` that appears in ACLs, e.g., for
   `group:prod` in Tailscale ACLs, specify `group_name=prod` in Sym.

### Example configuration

When configuring Tailscale to work with Sym, you will need to set up groups that Sym can add users to and
remove users from as their access is granted or revoked.

Use [ACL tags][acl-tags] when adding servers to your Tailscale network, so that their access is based on their
purpose. Then, you can allow [groups][groups] to have access to certain tags in Tailscale ACLs. You can also make a
group a [tag owner][tag-owner] if they should be able to manage tagged devices.

For example, if you want the SRE team `group:sre-prod` to be able to SSH into production servers with `tag:prod`,
you can set up a configuration like:

```json
{
  // This is the group that we will add/remove user to/from
  "groups": {
    "group:prod": []
  },
  // This allow users from the prod group to list Tailnet resources with the "tag:prod".
  "acls": [{ "action": "accept", "src": ["group:prod"], "dst": ["tag:prod:*"] }],
  // This allow users from the prod group to connect to instances with the `tag:prod`
  "ssh": [
    {
      "action": "accept",
      "src": ["group:prod"],
      "dst": ["tag:prod"],
      "users": ["ec2-user"]
    }
  ],
  "tagOwners": {
    "tag:prod": ["group:prod"]
  }
}
```

Now when an SRE needs to access production, they can use [Sym's Slack integration][sym-overview] to request temporary access to SSH into production.
