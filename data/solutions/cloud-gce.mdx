Google Cloud provides Linux virtual machines, to which Tailscale can be used to provide
secure connectivity.

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin this guide, you'll need a Tailscale network (known as a tailnet) set up and
configured with at least one existing device. Read our [getting started guide](/kb/1017/install)
if you need help with this.

#### Step 1: Set up the Tailscale client for the VM

First, [create a Virtual Machine in the GCE Console](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/create-start-instance).

When creating the instance click on **Management, security, disks, networking, sole tenancy**,
select **Networking**, and click on the **Network Interface**. Because we're later going to enable
subnet routing on this VM, we want to turn IP Forwarding to On.

Once the VM has been created, ssh to the system and follow the steps to
[install Tailscale on Linux](/kb/1031/install-linux/).

#### Step 2: Allow UDP port 41641

If at least one side of a tunnel has "easy NAT," where Tailscale can determine the UDP port
number on the far side of the NAT device, then it will make
[direct connections to minimize latency.](/blog/how-tailscale-works/)
We ensure that GCE nodes can make direct connections by allowing UDP port 41641 to ingress
through the firewall.

In **VPC Network** > **Firewall** we add two rules:

1. An ingress rule to allow 0.0.0.0/0 for UDP port 41641 to all instances.
1. An ingress rule to allow ::/0 for UDP port 41641 to all instances.

#### Step 3: Advertise routes from the VM

For the benefit of the _other_ nodes in the tailnet we'll set up
[split DNS](/kb/1054/dns/#using-dns-settings-in-the-admin-panel) to allow use of the same DNS names
as are used inside of GCE. The hostnames inside of GCE are of the form
_vm-name_._gce-project-name_.internal

We'll have the VM advertise routes for the subnet it sits on. For example if the subnet address
range is 10.182.0.0/24, the command would be:

```shell
tailscale up --advertise-routes=10.182.0.0/24 --accept-dns=false
```

<Note>
  For GCE VMs it is generally best to let Google handle the DNS configuration, not have Tailscale
  override it, so we added `--accept-dns=false`.
</Note>

#### Step 4: Add GCE DNS for your tailnet

Use the Google Cloud CLI command [`gcloud dns policies create`][gcloud-dns-policies-create] to
create a new [Cloud DNS][cloud-dns] policy that allows inbound forwarding for your tailnet:

```shell
gcloud dns policies create inbound-dns \
  --project="YOUR_VPC_PROJECT" \
  --description="Expose DNS endpoints per subnet" \
  --networks="YOUR_VPC" \
  --enable-inbound-forwarding
```

where:

- `YOUR_VPC_PROJECT` is your Google Cloud [project ID][project-id].
- `YOUR_VPC` is the comma separated list of network names to associate with the policy.

Use the [`gcloud compute addresses list`][gcloud-compute-addresses-list] to verify that your tailnet
recognizes the DNS resolver for your tailnet subnet:

```shell
gcloud compute addresses list \
  --project="YOUR_VPC_PROJECT" \
  --filter='purpose="DNS_RESOLVER"' \
  --format='csv(address, region, subnetwork)' \
  | grep YOUR_TAILNET_SUBNET
```

where:

- `YOUR_VPC_PROJECT` is your Google Cloud [project ID][project-id].
- `YOUR_TAILNET_SUBNET` is your subnet machine name.

Use the IP address returned from this command as a DNS resolver for your tailnet:

1. Open the [**DNS**](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns) page in the admin console.
1. Click **Add name server**.
1. Click **Custom**.
1. For **Nameserver**, enter the IP address from the `gcloud compute addresses list` command that
   you ran above. In this example, we use 10.243.117.59.
1. Ensure **Restrict to search domain** is checked.
1. For **Search Domain**, enter **internal**.
1. Click **Save**.

/>

Now the same hostnames which work between nodes running within
GCE will also be available to all nodes on your tailnet.

#### Step 5: Remove public SSH access

As we can now ssh to the system over the private Tailscale network, there is no reason to leave
the SSH port open on a public IP address. The `default-allow-ssh` rule can be deleted from
**VPC network** > **Firewall**.
