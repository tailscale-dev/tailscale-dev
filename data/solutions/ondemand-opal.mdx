[Opal][opal] is a centralized authorization platform for IT and infrastructure teams to make access
management requests self-service.

On-demand access to Tailscale resources can be provisioned using Opal. This works by adding and
removing members from [SSH access rules][ssh-access-rules]
for [ACL tags][acl-tags].

Opal can also be used with [user & group provisioning][provisioning] to update group membership in Okta groups used in
Tailscale ACLs, or assign the Tailscale application users in Okta.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this guide, you’ll need a tailnet and an Opal account.

- For information about creating a tailnet, see the [Tailscale quickstart][tailscale-quickstart].

- For information about creating an Opal account, see [Opal][opal].

## Integration

See the full instructions in Opal’s [blog post][blog-post] for setting up an integration with Tailscale.

To use Opal with Tailscale, you’ll need to:

1. Generate a Tailscale [API access token][access-token] from the [keys page][keys-page] of the admin console.
1. In Opal, [add Tailscale as a new application][opal-create-tailscale].
   1. Set the **App Admin** to the team that should manage the Tailscale app in Opal.
   1. Enter a **Description** of how you use Tailscale, so colleagues know what they’re requesting access to. For example,
      “SSH access to the production network”.
   1. Set the **Tailnet name** to be your tailnet’s organization. For example, `example.com`, `myemail@example.com`, `example.github`,
      `example.org.github`, etc. You can find your organization in the [Settings][settings] page of the admin console.
   1. Set the **Tailscale API key** to the Tailscale API access token you generated.
1. Determine which Tailscale [ACL tags][acl-tags] should be imported into Opal. This is done by the App Admin. For each
   ACL tag that is selected, Opal will automatically parse the existing [access rules][access-rules] and
   [SSH access rules][ssh-access-rules] that apply to that tag, and which [groups][groups] have access to the tagged
   sources using those rules.

Now a user can request access or SSH access to a specific tag in Tailscale.
