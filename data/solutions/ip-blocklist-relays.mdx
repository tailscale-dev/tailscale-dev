If you're migrating from a traditional office network or a centralized VPN
concentrator, you might find you have external servers that don't run
Tailscale but still need to have their connections
secured.

Third-party services, or internal services running on "serverless" cloud
providers such as Heroku, might have configured an IP block list (sometimes
known as an IP allowlist) that are
expecting all your user traffic to originate from a single IP address or a
small number of IP addresses. Since Tailscale doesn't need to send all
traffic through a central concentrator, your user traffic will suddenly start
arriving from all over the Internet, running into the IP block list
protections operated by your service provider.

### What is an IP block list?

Traditionally, it has been hard to set up secure links between machines in
different locations. As a result, people would operate "internal use"
services that still use Internet-facing ports and IP addresses, then connect
to those servers from their office locations. We often see this behavior
with ssh, RDP (remote desktop protocol), and various web services.

The exposed port allows attacks from anywhere on the Internet, such as port
scanning, password guessing, infrastructure zero-days, and so on. Even if the
service itself requires encryption and 2-factor authentication, a bug
anywhere in the stack could result in a complete bypass of security
protections.

To make these kinds of attacks harder, traditional best practice is to
restrict, usually at the firewall level, which IP addresses are even allowed
to initiate connections to your service. This makes your server "invisible"
to most people on the Internet, so they don't even know where to attack.

Unfortunately, IP block lists have a few flaws:

- IP block lists are, essentially, "security by obscurity." If they can
  learn which IP addresses are allowed to initiate connections—and this is
  not always too hard to guess, if it's the IP address of your office network
  for example—then a sufficiently dedicated attacker can forge packets from
  that address, or take control of a machine located at that address (for
  example using a botnet), to talk to the server.

- Users are not all at a single location. Remote workers, multiple
  offices, or your own servers running in various datacenters will all
  generate traffic coming from different IP addresses. IP block lists need to
  get longer and longer in order to make sure all those locations can access
  the service, and the longer the block list, the more ways an attacker can get
  in.

- Cloud VPCs make IP address propagation even worse. If you have internal
  services running in a cloud provider and accessing the Internet via NAT
  gateways and elastic IPs, then your traffic might come from a variety of
  IPs, possibly entire subnets. This can require very wide IP block lists to
  cover, for example, entire AWS address blocks just in case your services get
  allocated one of those blocks. Needless to say, this makes an attacker's job
  much easier, since all they need to do is run their attack from one of those
  cloud providers, and wait until they get allocated an IP address in one of
  your permitted subnets.

- To avoid this problem, some companies route all their internal traffic
  through a single VPN concentrator or central Internet gateway/NAT. This
  makes all traffic seem to come from a single address, but adds a lot of
  latency for people whose devices are not geographically near the NAT. It
  also adds a single point of failure and a choke point for Internet
  bandwidth.

Nevertheless, IP block listed services are a fact of life. If you can't make
a secure VPN tunnel to your service provider, for example because you don't
have rights to install any software at the hosting provider or because the
software is operated by a third party, IP block lists are still considered a
best practice, in addition to other security measures.

### Using Tailscale to improve on IP block lists

In a pure Tailscale network, you don't need IP block lists because you have
something better: Tailscale's secure IP addresses, which aren't allowed over
the physical network, plus [Tailscale role-based ACLs](/kb/1018/acls), which
let you configure exactly which groups of users are allowed to see a
particular server. This allows you to build something like a central IP
block list, but using encryption keys instead of IP addresses for protection.

However, most networks are not pure Tailscale, and you eventually need to
integrate with a third-party service. Luckily, Tailscale can help you
greatly reduce the size of your IP block list (and thus the surface area for
attack), without centralizing your network access and while letting your
users access the service from anywhere. Plus, you can still use Tailscale
role-based ACLs to control access.

What we'll do is set up a Tailscale [subnet router](/kb/1019/subnets)
that can route traffic for just the servers with the block list.

The necessary steps are:

1.  Set up a Linux machine or VM node, ideally somewhere near the external
    service you want to reach. (For example, if the service is in us-west, start
    a Linux machine in a datacenter or cloud provider in us-west.) Make sure
    your VM has a public-facing, static IP address.

2.  Make sure the VM's public-facing IP address is in the IP block list of the
    service it needs to access. Eventually, you might want to remove all other
    IP addresses and subnets from the list.

3.  [Install tailscaled](/download/linux) on the Linux machine.

4.  Tell the Linux tailscaled to advertise that it can provide access to the IP
    address of the service in question. For example, let's say you want to
    access the service at 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4. You would use

    ```bash
    tailscale up --advertise-routes=8.8.8.8/32,8.8.4.4/32
    ```

5.  Ensure that your [tailnet policy file](/kb/1018/acls) is configured to allow the
    correct users or groups to be able to access the server IPs in question.

6.  As a Tailscale domain administrator, enable the advertised routes using
    the [admin console][admin].

That's it! Now all your organization's traffic to the external service will
be routed through your new subnet router, as long as it is permitted by your
tailnet policy file.

<Note>
  \-\-advertise-routes requires IP forwarding to be enabled. If you see an error about IP
  forwarding, [follow these steps](/kb/1019/subnets/#enable-ip-forwarding).

### How does it work?

Tailscale is a multi-point VPN, which means every client device (node) can
be connected to multiple servers and/or relays (other nodes) at the same
time. Because Tailscale's WireGuard connections are so lightweight, each
node can connect to as many other nodes as it wants, simultaneously.

In this example, what we've done is create a node that advertises a [subnet
route](/kb/1019/subnets) to your external service (in our example, 8.8.8.8/32
and 8.8.4.4/32). Normally, a subnet router is used to provide access to
an office network or VPC without having to install Tailscale on every node
on the subnet. But there's no particular reason a subnet route has to
include more than one or two machines, and there's no reason you can't
provide a route to an IP address that's on an external network.

The advertised route gets shared with the Tailscale coordination server.
Then the admin needs to approve it (this is to prevent abuse, since
otherwise any user could set up a node that tries to advertise subnet
routes), and the routing and public key information are distributed
automatically to every node in your network.

The [tailnet policy file](/kb/1018/acls) is compiled into
packet filters and then distributed automatically to each node as needed.
The packet filter provided to your Linux subnet router lets it automatically
restrict which users it will allow to access the external service.
