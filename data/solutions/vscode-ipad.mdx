[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has
quickly become the text editor many people use for their day-to-day work.
Its cross-platform compatibility, speed, and plethora of extensions make it an
easy choice.

Coder.com's [code-server](https://github.com/cdr/code-server) lets you run
VSCode on a server and access it on any device, including an iPad. This is a
natural pairing for Tailscale, which lets you secure a server, and easily
access it from anywhere.

However, [code-server isn't safe to expose over the public
internet](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/blob/main/docs/guide.md#3-expose-code-server),
which usually leads to installing a public-facing ssh proxy or an http
reverse proxy like nginx in front of it. Tailscale eliminates all that,
giving you a fast, private connection no matter where you are.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin this guide, you'll need a few things:

- An iPad or similar tablet, or a laptop to access your VSCode server
  remotely. An external keyboard and mouse input will
  make writing code easier.

- A server to host code-server. This guide assumes you're using an Ubuntu
  20.04 server, but the steps should be similar for most hosting providers
  and Ubuntu versions. You can also install code-server on a desktop
  computer or server at home.

- Lastly, you'll need a Tailscale account.
  You can [create a free solo account in a few seconds](https://login.tailscale.com/start).

#### Step 1: Install Tailscale on an Ubuntu server

After spinning up a new server, ssh into it with your account details.

```
ssh <username>@<server host ip>
```

From here, we'll install Tailscale. First, add Tailscale's package signing
key and repository. (If you're not using Ubuntu, skip these steps and follow
our [install instructions for your platform](/kb/1031/install-linux/)).

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/ubuntu/focal.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
curl -fsSL https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/ubuntu/focal.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tailscale.list
```

Then install Tailscale:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install tailscale
```

And finally, authenticate and connect this server to your Tailscale network.

```bash
sudo tailscale up
```

Now, let's confirm everything is working by ssh-ing into the server over
Tailscale. We'll exit the machine and re-ssh with our Tailscale IP.

First, find and copy [your machine's Tailscale IP](/kb/1033/ip-and-dns-addresses).
The easiest way to do this is to run

```
ip addr show tailscale0
```

And copy the 100.x.y.z address. Once you've found it, `exit` your ssh
session, and start a new one with your newly copied Tailscale IP.

```
ssh <username>@<copied 100.x.y.z address>
```

If you've enabled [MagicDNS](/kb/1081/magicdns/) on your network, you can
use your server's MagicDNS hostname instead of the IP address.

#### Step 2: Install code-server

On your server, run the following one-line command to install code-server.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://code-server.dev/install.sh | sh
```

You can also download pre-built binaries from their [GitHub releases
page](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/releases).

Once the installation is complete, configure code-server to start on boot by
running the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now code-server@$USER
```

code-server is now running on your local machine, on port 8080. Now, we'll
expose this server over Tailscale.

#### Step 3: Make code-server available on the Tailscale interface

By default, code-server only allows access from the local device
(127.0.0.1), and restricts access with a password.

Since we'll only be accessing code-server over Tailscale, and Tailscale
already uses your existing Single Sign-On (SSO) identity provider, there's
no need for password-based auth — we can already trust that you're
authorized if you can even access the server!

To do this, we'll update code-server's configuration. First, we'll open up
the config file at `~/.config/code-server/config.yaml`

The default config file looks something like this:

```yaml
bind-addr: 127.0.0.1:8080
auth: password
password: <random-password>
cert: false
```

We'll update the `auth` field to `none` and remove the `password` field, and
make the service available only on your Tailscale IP address.

After these changes, your config file should look like this (don't forget to
replace `<copied 100.x.y.z address>` with your Tailscale IP address!):

```yaml
bind-addr: <copied 100.x.y.z address>:8080
auth: none
cert: false
```

Apply these changes by restarting code server:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart code-server@$USER
```

#### Step 4: Install Tailscale on your iPad

The last step is to install and sign in to Tailscale on your iPad. You can
find Tailscale in the App Store. Make sure
you log in with the same account as on your server, so the two devices can
see each other.

<DownloadTailscale />

Once you're authenticated, you should be able to access your server from the
iPad by visiting `http://100.x.y.z:8080/`. (Make sure to fill in the right
IP address or MagicDNS hostname!)

#### Step 5: Write code!

You're done! Access your VSCode instance from anywhere. You can code from a
café near your home or from the other side of the world. It's all the same.
And it's only accessible over Tailscale.

There are a few caveats to coding on an iPad.

For more configuration options, explore the [code-server repository's FAQ
documentation](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/blob/main/docs/FAQ.md).

#### Bonus: use https with Let's Encrypt

code-server works fine over plain http (over an encrypted+authenticated
Tailscale link) but some features will be unavailable. To make it fully
functional, you'll need to set up https.

1. First, [get an automated Tailscale LetsEncrypt
   certificate](/kb/1153/enabling-https/).

2. Then, use that cert by setting up a [Caddy- or nginx-based web
   proxy](https://coder.com/docs/code-server/latest/guide#using-lets-encrypt-with-nginx).

#### Bonus: additional firewall settings

Since we'll be developing on this device, chances are it'll have access to
sensitive information: private code, private data, etc. To keep things safe,
you may want to restrict all access to the server to only be over Tailscale.

For more details on how to further lock down a server, [read our guide on
Ubuntu and ufw](/kb/1077/secure-server-ubuntu-18-04).
