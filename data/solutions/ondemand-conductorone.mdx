[ConductorOne][conductorone] is a security platform that allows you to manage access requests for your Tailscale entitlements.

On-demand access to Tailscale resources can be provisioned using ConductorOne. This works by adding and removing members from [groups][groups], [access rules][access-rules], and [SSH access rules][ssh-access-rules] defined in Tailscale ACLs.

ConductorOne can also be used with [user & group provisioning][provisioning] to update group membership in Okta groups used in Tailscale ACLs, or assign the Tailscale application users in Okta.

You can connect multiple tailnets to ConductorOne simultaneously.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this guide, you’ll need a tailnet and a ConductorOne account.

- For information about creating a tailnet, see the [Tailscale quickstart][tailscale-quickstart].

- For information about creating a ConductorOne account, see [ConductorOne][conductorone].

## Integration

See the full instructions in ConductorOne’s [blog post][blog-post] for setting up an integration with Tailscale.

To use ConductorOne with Tailscale, you’ll need to:

1. Generate a Tailscale [API access token][access-token] from the [keys page][keys-page] of the admin console.
1. In ConductorOne, select the **Tailscale** integration and then click **Add Connector**.
   1. Choose the option to **Create a new app**.
   1. Set the **Tailscale API key** to the Tailscale API access token you generated.
   1. Set the **Tailnet** to your tailnet’s organization. For example, `example.com`, `myemail@example.com`, `example.github`,
      `example.org.github`, etc. You can find your organization in the [Settings][settings] page of the admin console.

ConductorOne will automatically identify all the users in the tailnet and parse existing [access rules][access-rules] in Tailscale
ACLs, including [SSH access rules][ssh-access-rules], as entitlements in ConductorOne. The application owner in ConductorOne can specify for each
entitlement, such as group membership or another SSH access rule, whether to restrict access by time, and whether to
use the default application grant policy.

Now a user can request access to a specific Tailscale entitlement through the **Request access** page of ConductorOne and through Slack.
