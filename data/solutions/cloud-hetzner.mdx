Hetzner provides Linux virtual machines from several datacenters in Europe.
We can use Tailscale to securely access these servers.

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin this guide, you'll need a Tailscale network set up and configured with at
least one existing device. Read our [getting started guide](/kb/1017/install)
if you need help with this.

#### Step 1: Set up the Tailscale client for the VM

First, [create a Virtual Machine in the Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/).

ssh to the system and install the Tailscale client:

```sh
# curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
# tailscale up
```

In the next step we'll remove ssh access from the public IP address, so:

1. Find the tailscale IP address using [`tailscale ip`](/kb/1080/cli#ip).
1. Exit from the ssh session to the public IP address.
1. Make a new SSH session to the Tailscale IP address.

#### Step 2: Allow UDP port 41641

If at least one side of a tunnel has "easy NAT," where Tailscale can determine the UDP port
number on the far side of the NAT device, then it will make
[direct connections to minimize latency.](/blog/how-tailscale-works/)
We ensure that Hetzner nodes can make direct connections by allowing UDP port 41641 to ingress
through the firewall.

In the [Firewall tab of the Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) click
the **Create Firewall** button. Delete the SSH and ICMP rules and add a rule allowing UDP
port 41641.

If you want to allow direct connection _between_ Hetzner VMs, also add an outbound firewall rule
allowing UDP port 3478.
