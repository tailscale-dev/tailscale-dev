Tailscale makes it easy to securely connect to your
Synology NAS devices over WireGuard&reg;.

Tailscale is free for most personal uses, including accessing your NAS.

### Installation steps

1. Visit the Synology Package Center
   ([tutorial](https://kb.synology.com/en-sg/DSM/tutorial/How_to_install_applications_with_Package_Center)).

2. Search for and install the **Tailscale** app.

3. Once the app is installed, follow the instructions to Log in using your
   preferred identity provider. If you don't already have a Tailscale account,
   a free account will be created automatically.

4. Now your Synology NAS is available on your tailnet.
   Connect to it from your PC, laptop, phone, or tablet by [installing
   Tailscale on another device](https://tailscale.com/download).

That's it!

### Features

When used with Synology, Tailscale supports these features:

- Web-based login to any [supported identity
  provider](/kb/1013/sso-providers/).
- Access your Synology NAS from anywhere, [without
  opening firewall ports](/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/).
- Share your NAS with designated Tailscale users, using [node
  sharing](/kb/1084/sharing/).
- Restrict access to your NAS using [ACLs](/kb/1018/acls/).
- Use your NAS as a [subnet router](/kb/1019/subnets/) to provide
  external access to your LAN. (Currently requires command-line
  steps.)
- Use your NAS as an [exit node](/kb/1103/exit-nodes/) for secure
  Internet access from anywhere. (Currently requires command-line
  steps.)

### Limitations & known issues

Some things to be aware of:

- If you upgrade Synology from DSM6 to DSM7, you will need to uninstall and
  then reinstall the Tailscale app. **Do not perform the Synology DSM7 upgrade
  over Tailscale or you may lose your connection during the upgrade.**

- Tailscale uses [hybrid networking mode](/kb/1112/userspace-networking/)
  on Synology, which means that if you share subnets, they will be
  reachable over UDP and TCP, but not necessarily pingable.

- Other Synology packages cannot make outgoing connections to your other
  Tailscale nodes by default on DSM7. See instructions below to enable.

- Tailscale on Synology currently can do `--advertise-routes` but not
  `--accept-routes`. This means that if you have other [subnet routers](/kb/1019/subnets/),
  devices on those other subnets will not yet be able to reach your NAS or
  devices on its local subnet.

- Advertising subnet routes can only be configured from the command
  line, not the web GUI.

- [Tailscale SSH](/kb/1193/tailscale-ssh) does not run on Synology.

Some of those limitations are imposed on Tailscale by the DSM7
sandbox. Others we intend to fix in future releases of Tailscale.

See our [Synology tracking issue on GitHub](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/1995)
for the latest status on the above issues.

### Manual installation steps

An alternative to the recommended approach of [installing Tailscale from the Synology Package Center](#installation-steps)
is to install Tailscale using a downloadable Synology package (SPK). A reason you might want to install from an SPK is to
access new Tailscale features that are not yet released in the Tailscale version that is available from the Synology
Package Center.

To manually install Tailscale:

1. Download the SPK for your Synology device from the [Tailscale Packages](https://pkgs.tailscale.com/) server.
   Synology SPKs are available from both [stable](https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/#spks) and
   [unstable](https://pkgs.tailscale.com/unstable/#spks) release tracks. To determine which download is appropriate for
   your Synology device, visit the [Synology and SynoCommunity Package Architectures][synology-architectures] page and look up
   your architecture by Synology model. Then, find the SPK download at [Tailscale Packages](https://pkgs.tailscale.com/)
   that corresponds to your model.

1. In the Synology DSM web admin UI, go to **Main menu** > **Package Center**.

1. Click **Manual Install**, click **Browse**, select the SPK (.spk) file that you downloaded, and then
   click **Next**.

1. Follow the remaining prompts to confirm settings and complete installation.

1. At this point `tailscaled` should be up and running on your Synology device and you can configure it either
   using the Tailscale package's Synology web UI or [the CLI](/kb/1080/cli/) over SSH. (For instructions on
   using SSH to access Synology, see [How can I sign in to DSM/SRM with root privilege via SSH?][synology-ssh]).

### Enabling Synology outbound connections

Synology DSM7 introduced tighter restrictions on what packages are
allowed to do. If you're running DSM6, Tailscale runs as root with
full permissions and these steps are not required.

By default, Tailscale on Synology with DSM7 only allows inbound
connections to your Synology device but outbound Tailscale access
from other apps running on your Synology is not enabled.

The reason for this is that the Tailscale package does not have permission
to create a [TUN device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUN/TAP).

To enable TUN, to permit outbound connections from other things
running on your Synology:

1. Make sure you're running Tailscale 1.22.2 or later, either
   from the Synology Package Center or a manually installed `*.spk` from the
   [Tailscale Packages](https://pkgs.tailscale.com/) server.

1. In Synology, go to **Control Panel** > **Task Scheduler**, click **Create**, and select **Triggered Task**.

1. Select **User-defined script**.

1. When the **Create task** window appears, click **General**.

1. In **General Settings**, enter a task name, select **root** as the user that the task will run
   for, and select **Boot-up** as the event that triggers the task. Ensure the task is enabled.

1. Click **Task Settings** and enter the following for **User-defined script**.

   ```sh
   /var/packages/Tailscale/target/bin/tailscale configure-host; synosystemctl restart pkgctl-Tailscale.service
   ```

   (If you're curious what it does, you can [read the `configure-host` code](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/blob/main/cmd/tailscale/cli/configure-host.go))

1. Click **OK** to save the settings.

1. Reboot your Synology. (Alternatively, to avoid a reboot, run the
   above user-defined script as root on the device and then restart
   the Tailscale package.)

Your TUN settings should now be persisted across reboots of your device.

###### If the Synology firewall is enabled: adjust the firewall settings

By enabling TUN, Tailscale traffic will be subject to Synology's built-in firewall.

The firewall is disabled by default.
However, if you have it enabled, add an exception for the Tailscale subnet, 100.64.0.0/10.
In **Main menu** > **Control Panel** > **Security** > **Firewall**, add a firewall rule in the default profile that allows traffic from the source IP subnet 100.64.0.0 with subnet mask 255.192.0.0.

### Special thanks

Special thanks to [Guilherme de Maio (nirev)](https://github.com/nirev/), who contributed the
original [Synology-Tailscale package builder](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-synology).
Tailscale now maintains this package builder and produces our official
Synology packages.
