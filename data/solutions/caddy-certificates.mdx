[Caddy][caddy] is a web server that makes HTTPS easy. Starting with the beta release of
[Caddy 2.5][release], Caddy supports Tailscale. When Caddy gets an HTTPS request for a `*.ts.net`
site, it gets the HTTPS certificate from the machine's local Tailscale daemon. There's no
configuration required for the certificate. For example, you can use a [Caddyfile][caddyfile] for a
static file server, and it automatically enables HTTPS:

```
machine-name.domain-alias.ts.net

root * /var/www
file_server
```

#### Provide non-root users with access to fetch certificate

If Caddy is running as a non-root user, such as when it runs on Debian as `caddy`, you need to
modify `/etc/default/tailscaled` to grant the user access to fetch the certificate.
In `/etc/default/tailscaled`, set the `TS_PERMIT_CERT_UID` environment variable to the name or ID
of the non-root user:

```
TS_PERMIT_CERT_UID=caddy
```
