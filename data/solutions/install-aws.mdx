Recent versions of Tailscale work fine even when nodes are placed behind an
Amazon Managed NAT Gateway. However, because of the way the Managed NAT
Gateway works, it blocks Tailscale's direct UDP connections, which slows it
down and adds latency.

To avoid this issue, you can install one Tailscale node on your AWS network
and have it route traffic on behalf of your whole VPC (Virtual Private
Cloud) subnet. This maximizes performance and minimizes bandwidth costs.

In the steps below, we'll set up a fresh Amazon EC2 VPC with Amazon Managed
NAT Gateway, then configure a Tailscale relay to offer secure access to that
VPC. We'll create a new VPC from scratch, but once you're comfortable, you
can adapt these instructions to set up Tailscale on an existing VPC too.

#### Step 1: Create an Elastic IP

From the AWS admin console, [create an Elastic IP][eip]. This will be the IP of
your Managed NAT Gateway.

[eip]: https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home#Addresses

#### Step 2: Create a VPC

Use the **VPC with Public and Private Subnets** configuration. This is most easily
done through the [**VPC Wizard**, option #2][wizard]. In the wizard, give it a
name, and assign the Elastic IP you created above to the NAT gateway. You can
leave everything else at the default values.

[wizard]: https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?region=us-east-1#wizardSelector

#### Step 3: Create an EC2 relay

Create an instance with the following configuration:

1. Use one of the [supported linux distros](/kb/1017/install).
1. Assign the instance to the VPC you created above.
1. Assign the instance to the public subnet of the VPC, and give it a public IP address.
1. In the security groups configuration, allow inbound ssh. (We'll need
   this during initial setup, but you can turn it off later.)
1. Name the security group something distinctive, like "tailscale-relay"

#### Step 4: Install Tailscale on your EC2 relay

ssh into the EC2 instance and install Tailscale by following [the install
instructions for your distro](/download/linux).

Once installed, enable the Tailscale systemd service, and authenticate the
machine to your Tailscale network by visiting a link in your browser

```
sudo systemctl enable --now tailscaled
sudo tailscale up --advertise-routes=10.0.0.0/24,10.0.1.0/24
```

<Note>
  \-\-advertise-routes requires IP forwarding to be enabled. If you see an error about IP
  forwarding, [follow these
  steps](/kb/1023/troubleshooting#why-do-i-get-an-error-about-ip-forwarding-when-using-advertise-routes).
</Note>

#### Step 5: Configure your Tailscale network

Visit the [admin console][admin] and perform the following actions:

1. [Disable key expiry](/kb/1028/key-expiry) so that you don't need to
   reauthenticate the server periodically.
1. Authorize subnet routes on the machine, so that Tailscale
   distributes the `10.0.0.0/24` and `10.0.1.0/24` routes to the rest
   of your Tailscale network.

#### Step 6: Verify your connection

Check that you can ping the EC2 instance's Tailscale IP address from your
personal Tailscale machine (Windows, macOS, etc). You can find the Tailscale IP
in the [admin console][admin], or by running `tailscale ip -4` on
the EC2 instance.

#### Step 7: Close off your firewall

Edit the "tailscale-relay" security group settings, and remove ssh access. At
this point, you are able to ssh to the EC2 instance securely over Tailscale, so
you can close the hole in your public-facing firewall.

#### Step 8: Create another EC2 instance to relay to

Create an EC2 private instance with the following configuration:

1. Use one of the [supported linux distros](/kb/1017/install).
1. Assign the instance to the VPC you created above.
1. Assign the instance to the private subnet of the VPC, and do
   _not_ give it a public IP.
1. In the security groups configuration, allow all traffic inbound
   from the "tailscale-relay" security group.

ssh to your newly created private EC2 instance, using its private
IP. The ssh session will flow through your Tailscale subnet router
and into the private VPC.

#### 4via6 subnet routers

If your network has subnets with overlapping IPv4 addresses, you can use the [4via6 subnet routers][4via6]
feature to ensure traffic from each node on your tailnet is routed to the correct device.
