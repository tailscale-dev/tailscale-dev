Heroku is a popular cloud-hosting platform for running applications without managing servers yourself. However, it can be difficult to use Tailscale on Heroku, since it doesn't provide a /dev/net/tun device that Tailscale needs.

In Tailscale v1.8 or later, you can use Tailscale's [userspace networking mode](/kb/1112/userspace-networking) to connect your apps to your Tailscale network.

#### Step 1: Generate an auth key to authenticate your Heroku apps

First, we'll [generate an auth key](/kb/1085/auth-keys) to allow Heroku to authenticate our app to join our network.

Navigate to [the auth keys page of the admin console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/authkeys). We recommend using an [ephemeral key](/kb/1111/ephemeral-nodes) for this purpose, since it will automatically clean up devices after they shut down.

Next, navigate to your [Heroku app's settings](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) and then the Config Vars section. From here, add a new Config Var named `TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY`, with the `tskey-<key>` value you just created.

#### Step 2: Configure your Dockerfile to install Tailscale

We recommend using a [multistage Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/#use-multi-stage-builds) where the first stage builds your application, the second fetches and unpacks Tailscale binaries, and the final stage pulls application code and Tailscale into the final image to be uploaded to Heroku.

Create a `Dockerfile` at the root of your app. In that `Dockerfile` add something like:

```docker
FROM golang:1.16.2-alpine3.13 as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . ./
# This is where one could build the application code as well.


FROM alpine:latest as tailscale
WORKDIR /app
ENV TSFILE={{< pkgversion binary="amd64" >}}
RUN wget https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/${TSFILE} && \
  tar xzf ${TSFILE} --strip-components=1


FROM alpine:latest
RUN apk update && apk add ca-certificates && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*

# Copy binary to production image
COPY --from=builder /app/start.sh /app/start.sh
COPY --from=tailscale /app/tailscaled /app/tailscaled
COPY --from=tailscale /app/tailscale /app/tailscale
RUN mkdir -p /var/run/tailscale /var/cache/tailscale /var/lib/tailscale

# Run on container startup.
CMD ["/app/start.sh"]
```

The Dockerfile specifies `/app/start.sh` as the initial process to run. This script needs to bring Tailscale up and then start the application binary. This is where we can use the `TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY` variable we defined earlier.

Then, create a file named `start.sh` at the root of your app:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

/app/tailscaled --tun=userspace-networking --socks5-server=localhost:1055 &
/app/tailscale up --authkey=${TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY} --hostname=heroku-app
echo Tailscale started
ALL_PROXY=socks5://localhost:1055/ /app/my-app
```

Done! The next time your Heroku app deploys, it should be able to connect to your private Tailscale network.
