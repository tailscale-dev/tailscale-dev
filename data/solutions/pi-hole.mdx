One common use of a Raspberry Pi is to run a
[Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net), a DNS-based ad blocking services. A
typical setup is to have a Raspberry Pi in your house running Pi-hole,
acting as the DNS server for your local Wi-Fi network.

This works great when you're at home. However, it only works when
you're at home. If you want to use your Pi-hole to block ads from
anywhere, you need to be able to connect to your Pi-hole from
anywhere.

<Note>
  Can't get a Raspberry Pi right now? We can't either. You can also try setting up [NextDNS as a
  global nameserver](https://tailscale.com/kb/1218/nextdns) in your tailnet to block ads and
  trackers.

### What not to do

The most obvious way to do this is to run a Pi-hole in the cloud.

Without a lot of precautions, this is a bad idea: Unscrupulous actors
can [use your Pi-hole to attack other parts of the
internet](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/dns-amplification-ddos-attack/).

You also have to pay for and trust a cloud server. Part of the charm
of the Pi-hole is that it is cheap and easy to buy your own Raspberry
Pi, set it up, put it on a shelf, and forget about it.

### The easy way: Tailscale

Tailscale lets you easily and securely connect all of your devices. It
lets you pick a DNS server to use. And that's all you need!

Tailscale is free for most personal use cases like this.

#### Step 1: Install Tailscale on your Raspberry Pi

You can find instructions at this link:

<DownloadTailscale />

When running `tailscale up`, you'll need to pass the
`--accept-dns=false` flag. Pi-Hole uses DNS servers configured within
Linux as its upstream servers, where it will send DNS queries that it
cannot answer on its own. Since we're going to make the Pi-Hole _be_
our DNS server, we don't want Pi-Hole trying to use itself as its own
upstream.

```
tailscale up --accept-dns=false
```

Once installed, and you've run `tailscale up --accept-dns=false` on
your Raspberry Pi, continue on.

#### Step 2: Install Tailscale on your other devices

We have easy installation instructions for any platform:

<DownloadTailscale />

#### Step 3: Set your Raspberry Pi as your DNS server

You can configure DNS for your entire Tailscale network from
[Tailscale's admin console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns). Go
to [the DNS page](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns) and enter
your Raspberry Pi's Tailscale IP address as a global nameserver.

You can find your Raspberry Pi's Tailscale IP address from the
[machines page](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines) of the
admin console, or on your Raspberry Pi by [following these
instructions](https://tailscale.com/kb/1033/ip-and-dns-addresses/).

Since we want our network-wide DNS to override any local DNS settings
that devices have, make sure you enable the **Override local DNS**
toggle after adding your Raspberry Pi's Tailscale IP address.

#### Step 4: Disable key expiry

Tailscale occasionally requires you to re-authenticate your machines,
to keep your network secure. To avoid DNS interruptions when that
happens, visit the [machines page of the admin
console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines) to [disable key
expiry](https://tailscale.com/kb/1028/key-expiry/) on your Raspberry
Pi.

/>

#### Step 5: Done!

That's it! Now whenever you are logged in to Tailscale, that device will automatically use your Pi-hole for DNS.

If your Pi-hole is blocking something you need access to, you can
disable it by disconnecting from Tailscale, and reconnecting when you
are ready.

Once you are set up with Tailscale, you might want to explore other
possibilities, like [using
Taildrop](https://tailscale.com/kb/1106/taildrop/) to send files from
one of your devices to another, or making your own privacy VPN by
using your Raspberry Pi as an [exit
node](https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes/).

#### Optional: Share your Pi-Hole with a friend

You can share your Pi-Hole with friends using Tailscale. Follow [our
guide to sharing nodes with other
users](https://tailscale.com/kb/1084/sharing). Once you've shared your
Pi-Hole and your friends have accepted the invitation, they can follow
[Step 3 from this
guide](#step-3-set-your-raspberry-pi-as-your-dns-server) to add it as
a DNS server in their network too.

#### Troubleshooting

##### Pi-hole works when I use 192.168.x.x as my DNS server, but not with 100.x.x.x?

In the Pi-hole **Admin** page in **Settings** > **DNS**, make sure
that **Listen on all interfaces, permit all origins** is selected.

Tailscale traffic comes in on the tailscale0 network interface, so
this option is needed to allow your Pi-Hole to respond to
Tailscale-based DNS traffic. When using this option, make sure your
Pi-Hole is properly firewalled.
