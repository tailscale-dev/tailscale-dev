AWS Lightsail is a low cost means of running either virtual machines or containers. The container deployments in Lightsail can make it difficult to use Tailscale, since it doesn't provide a /dev/net/tun device that Tailscale needs.

In Tailscale v1.12 or later, you can use Tailscale's [userspace networking mode](/kb/1112/userspace-networking) to connect your AWS Lightsail apps to your Tailscale network.

#### Step 1: Generate an auth key to authenticate your AWS Lightsail containers

First, we'll [generate an auth key](/kb/1085/auth-keys) to allow AWS Lightsail to authenticate our container to join our network.

Navigate to [the auth keys page of the admin console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/authkeys). We recommend using an [ephemeral key](/kb/1111/ephemeral-nodes) for this purpose, since it will automatically clean up devices after they shut down.

Next, [navigate to the AWS Lightsail](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/) Containers tab, and create a new deployment for a container service. In the Containers section of the configuration is an **Add environment variables** link. Make the variable key `TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY` with a value of the `tskey-<key>` string generated earlier.

#### Step 2: Configure your Dockerfile to install Tailscale

Next, we'll use a [multistage Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/#use-multi-stage-builds), where the first stage builds your application, the second fetches and unpacks Tailscale binaries, and the final stage pulls application code and Tailscale into the final image to be uploaded to AWS.

In your `Dockerfile`:

```docker
FROM alpine:latest as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . ./
# This is where one could build the application code as well.


FROM alpine:latest as tailscale
WORKDIR /app
ENV TSFILE={{< pkgversion binary="amd64" >}}
RUN wget https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/${TSFILE} && \
  tar xzf ${TSFILE} --strip-components=1


FROM alpine:latest
# Copy binary to production image
COPY --from=builder /app/bootstrap /var/runtime/bootstrap
COPY --from=tailscale /app/tailscaled /var/runtime/tailscaled
COPY --from=tailscale /app/tailscale /var/runtime/tailscale
RUN mkdir -p /var/run && ln -s /tmp/tailscale /var/run/tailscale && \
    mkdir -p /var/cache && ln -s /tmp/tailscale /var/cache/tailscale && \
    mkdir -p /var/lib && ln -s /tmp/tailscale /var/lib/tailscale && \
    mkdir -p /var/task && ln -s /tmp/tailscale /var/task/tailscale

EXPOSE 8080

# Run on container startup.
ENTRYPOINT ["/var/runtime/bootstrap"]
```

The Dockerfile specifies `/var/runtime/bootstrap` as the initial process to run. This script needs to bring Tailscale up and then start the application binary. This is where we can use the `TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY` variable we defined earlier.

Then, create a file named `bootstrap` at the root of your app:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

mkdir -p /tmp/tailscale
/var/runtime/tailscaled --tun=userspace-networking --socks5-server=localhost:1055 &
/var/runtime/tailscale up --authkey=${TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY} --hostname=aws-lightsail-app
echo Tailscale started
ALL_PROXY=socks5://localhost:1055/ /var/runtime/my-app
```

Done! When your AWS Lightsail container deploys, it should be able to connect to your private Tailscale network.
