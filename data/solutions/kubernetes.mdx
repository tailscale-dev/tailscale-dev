Kubernetes is a popular method for deploying, scaling, and managing containerized
applications. There are many ways you can run Tailscale in inside a Kubernetes Cluster,
e.g., as a sidecar, as a proxy, or as a subnet router. This doc shows several common ways.

### Tailscale's managed Docker image

Tailscale has a published Docker image that Tailscale manages and builds from source. It's available in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tailscale/tailscale) and [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/orgs/tailscale/packages/container/package/tailscale), just run:

```bash
docker pull tailscale/tailscale:latest
```

or

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/tailscale/tailscale:latest
```

The current version of the `Makefile` required for the examples in this doc is in the [tailscale repo](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/blob/main/docs/k8s/Makefile).

### Prerequisites

You can follow the examples in this doc by cloning from GitHub. For example:

```bash
gh repo clone tailscale/tailscale
cd tailscale/docs/k8s
```

### Setup

1. (Optional) You can choose to use an [auth key][auth keys] to automate your container logging in
   to your tailnet. Create an auth key in the [**Keys**][auth keys page] page of the admin console.
   We recommend using an [ephemeral key][ephemeral node] for this purpose, since it will
   automatically clean up devices after they shut down. We also recommend using a
   [reusable key][reusable key] so when containers are stopped and started they can still connect to
   your tailnet.

/>

If you don't provide the key, you can still authenticate by logging in at the URL provided in logs when using the container image below.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: tailscale-auth
stringData:
  TS_AUTHKEY: tskey-0123456789abcdef
```

1. Build and push the container

   ```bash
   export IMAGE_TAG=tailscale-k8s:latest
   make push
   ```

1. Tailscale (v1.16 or later) supports storing state inside a
   [Kubernetes Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

   Configure role-based access control (RBAC) to allow the Tailscale pod to read/write the `tailscale` secret.

   ```bash
   export SA_NAME=tailscale
   export TS_KUBE_SECRET=tailscale-auth
   make rbac
   ```

### Sample Sidecar

Running as a sidecar allows you to directly expose a Kubernetes pod over Tailscale. This is particularly useful if you do not wish to expose a service on the public internet. This method allows bi-directional connectivity between the pod and other devices on the tailnet. You can use [ACLs][acls] to control traffic flow.

1. Create and login to the sample nginx pod with a Tailscale sidecar:

   ```bash
   make sidecar
   # If not using an auth key, authenticate by grabbing the Login URL here:
   kubectl logs nginx ts-sidecar
   ```

1. Check if you can connect to nginx over Tailscale:

   ```bash
   curl http://nginx
   ```

   Or, if you have [MagicDNS][magicdns] disabled:

   ```bash
   curl "http://$(tailscale ip -4 nginx)"
   ```

### Userspace Sidecar

You can also run the sidecar in [userspace networking mode][userspace]. The obvious benefit is reducing the amount of permissions Tailscale needs to run. The downside is that for outbound connectivity from the pod to the tailnet you would need to use either the [SOCKS5 proxy or HTTP proxy][socks5 vs http].

1. Create and login to the sample nginx pod with a Tailscale sidecar:

   ```bash
   make userspace-sidecar
   # If not using an auth key, authenticate by grabbing the Login URL here:
   kubectl logs nginx ts-sidecar
   ```

1. Check if you can connect to nginx over Tailscale:

   ```bash
   curl http://nginx
   ```

   Or, if you have [MagicDNS][magicdns] disabled:

   ```bash
   curl "http://$(tailscale ip -4 nginx)"
   ```

### Sample Proxy

Running a Tailscale proxy allows you to provide inbound connectivity to a Kubernetes Service.

1. Provide the `ClusterIP` of the service you want to reach by either:

   **Creating a new deployment**

   ```bash
   kubectl create deployment nginx --image nginx
   kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80
   export TS_DEST_IP="$(kubectl get svc nginx -o=jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}')"
   ```

   **Using an existing service**

   ```bash
   export TS_DEST_IP="$(kubectl get svc <SVC_NAME> -o=jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}')"
   ```

1. Deploy the proxy pod:

   ```bash
   make proxy
   # If not using an auth key, authenticate by grabbing the Login URL here:
   kubectl logs proxy
   ```

1. Check if you can connect to nginx over Tailscale:

   ```bash
   curl http://proxy
   ```

   Or, if you have [MagicDNS][magicdns] disabled:

   ```bash
   curl "http://$(tailscale ip -4 proxy)"
   ```

### Subnet Router

Running a Tailscale [subnet router][subnets] allows you to access the entire Kubernetes cluster network (assuming NetworkPolicies allow) over Tailscale.

1. Identify the Pod/Service CIDRs that cover your Kubernetes cluster. These will vary depending on [which CNI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/) you are using and on the Cloud Provider you are using. Add these to the `TS_ROUTES` variable as comma-separated values.

   ```bash
   SERVICE_CIDR=10.20.0.0/16
   POD_CIDR=10.42.0.0/15
   export TS_ROUTES=$SERVICE_CIDR,$POD_CIDR
   ```

1. Deploy the subnet-router pod.

   ```bash
   make subnet-router
   # If not using an auth key, authenticate by grabbing the Login URL here:
   kubectl logs subnet-router
   ```

1. In the [**Machines**][machines page] page of the admin console, ensure that the routes for the subnet-router are enabled.

1. Make sure that any client you want to connect from has `--accept-routes` enabled.

1. Check if you can connect to a `ClusterIP` or a `PodIP` over Tailscale:

   ```bash
   # Get the Service IP
   INTERNAL_IP="$(kubectl get svc <SVC_NAME> -o=jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}')"
   # or, the Pod IP
   # INTERNAL_IP="$(kubectl get po <POD_NAME> -o=jsonpath='{.status.podIP}')"
   INTERNAL_PORT=8080
   curl http://$INTERNAL_IP:$INTERNAL_PORT
   ```

### Optional: Add DNS information

By default, we do not set DNS for containers. To enable [MagicDNS][magicdns] for a Kubernetes container, you will need to export `TS_ACCEPT_DNS=true` in the environment.
