Oracle Cloud provides Linux virtual machines, notably featuring the ARM CPU architecture.
We can use Tailscale to securely access Oracle virtual machines.

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin this guide, you'll need a Tailscale network set up and configured with at
least one existing device. Read our [getting started guide](/kb/1017/install)
if you need help with this.

#### Step 1: Set up the Tailscale client for the VM

First, [create a Virtual Machine in the OCN Console](https://cloud.oracle.com/compute/instances/create).

ssh to the system and follow the steps to
[install Tailscale on Oracle Linux](/kb/1031/install-linux/).

#### Step 2: Allow UDP port 41641

If at least one side of a tunnel has "easy NAT," where Tailscale can determine the UDP port
number on the far side of the NAT device, then it will make
[direct connections to minimize latency.](/blog/how-tailscale-works/)
We ensure that OCN nodes can make direct connections by allowing UDP port 41641 to ingress
through the firewall.

In the [Networking tab](https://cloud.oracle.com/networking/vcns/) select **Virtual Cloud Networks**
select the specific VCN the VM has been created on.

Select **Security Lists** in the left hand column, and the security list in use (probably
a Default).

Add a Stateless ingress rule for 0.0.0.0/0 UDP port 41641.

#### Step 3: Advertise routes from the VM

For the benefit of the _other_ nodes in the tailnet we'll set up
[split DNS](/kb/1054/dns/#using-dns-settings-in-the-admin-panel) to allow
use of the same DNS names as are used inside of Oracle Cloud. The DNS server provided by Oracle
is 169.254.169.254, and supports hostnames of the form instance.subnet01234567.vcn01234567.oraclevcn.com.

We'll have our VM advertise routes for both the subnet it sits on as well as the Oracle DNS
server. For example if the subnet address range is 10.0.0.0/24, the command would be:

```
tailscale up --advertise-routes=10.0.0.0/24,169.254.169.254/32 --accept-dns=false
```

<Note>
  For Oracle Cloud VMs it is generally best to let Oracle handle the DNS configuration, not have
  Tailscale override it, so we added `--accept-dns=false`.
</Note>

#### Step 4: Add Oracle DNS for your tailnet

In the [admin console DNS section](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns) we add a nameserver
restricted to the `oraclevcn.com` domain, pointing to the Oracle DNS server which we
made available through our VM.

/>

Now the same hostnames which work between nodes running within Oracle Cloud will also be available
to all nodes on our tailnet.

#### Step 5: Remove public SSH access

As we can now ssh to the system over the private Tailscale network, there is no reason to leave
the SSH port open on a public IP address. In the Network > Security List the SSH rule can be
removed.

#### Troubleshooting

If you find that your tailnet nodes cannot access your Oracle Cloud Linux VM, you may need to update
the VM's `iptables` configuration.

Before you modify `iptables`, make a backup of the current configuration:

```
sudo iptables-save > ~/iptables.old
```

Check your current `iptables` configuration by running:

```
sudo iptables --list --line-numbers
```

If you want to provide HTTP access from your tailnet to the VM, run:

```
sudo iptables -I INPUT 6 -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
sudo netfilter-persistent save
```

Alternatively, if you see a specific rule that is rejecting your ingress access, you can delete it
by line number:

```
sudo iptables -D INPUT <line-number>
```

Check the `iptables` list again to make sure your change is in effect.

```
sudo iptables --list --line-numbers
```

Then, try accessing the Oracle Cloud Linux VM from your tailnet node again.
