Hello, world! I'm Xe, and I am the first Developer Advocate at
Tailscale. I'm a [prolific blogger](https://xeiaso.net/blog), VTuber,
and an avid technologist. I started working on Developer Relations
(DevRel) at Tailscale in Spring 2022. Today I'm going to trace through
the history of DevRel at Tailscale and how working on DevRel has
transformed a part of me from being an impediment that I was at war
with into a catalytic asset that makes my job easier.

In Spring 2022, I sat down and started to take DevRel seriously at
Tailscale. I had heard about the practice in the past, but I had never
done it before. I knew that a lot of it was talking about a product to
people and finding new and interesting ways to use it, but a lot of
that seemed too vague to really have any solid place to start from.
It's like walking into an empty room and having no idea where to start
decorating.

At some level though, it felt _right_ for me in a way that I have
difficulty describing. It's the same feeling of it being _right_ that
I get from working in software in the first place. It felt like the
type of rabbit-hole you could spend an entire career in. After talking
it over with some peers, I found out that what I was doing was already
a split between my normal job and DevRel. I was talking about
Tailscale in places. I was figuring out new and interesting ways to
use Tailscale. I was advocating for developers to build things on top
of Tailscale. It was working too, so all I had to do was do more of
it.

I got permission from my manager to get a 50/50 split between what I
was doing (work on internal tooling that was not sparking joy) and
this new experimental DevRel thing. I took the leap and I don't think
I am ever going to look back.

In 2022 I published a lot of projects, tools, and ways to use
Tailscale that still come up every so often. I made an
[nginx-auth](https://tailscale.com/blog/tailscale-auth-nginx/) tool
for a blogpost and it comes up in sales calls every so often. I was
originally going to make the [GitOps for
ACLs](https://tailscale.com/blog/gitops-acls/) tool into something for
a blogpost, but it ended up becoming a fully fledged product feature
and something that is currently in use by developers all over the
world. I managed to expense a scalped Steam Deck off of eBay and wrote
up [how I figured out how to install Tailscale on
it](https://tailscale.com/blog/steam-deck/).

One of the primary challenges in starting out with something new like
this in an existing company is that you need to _define_ what DevRel
means. You need to have an _idea_ that you can use as the main point
of alignment so that you and the people following in your footsteps
can all focus on different aspects of that same idea. When I was
thinking out what DevRel could mean, one of the topics that kept
coming back up was the idea of Tailscale being everywhere with you so
you can get back home. This was the heart of the Steam Deck article,
among other ones. One of the next ideas I worked under was the idea
that Tailscale knows who you are, so apps can easily know who you are
too.

This is the heart of how nearly every one of the Tailscale as an
authentication factor tricks works. Tailscale already maintains a list
of IP address to user mappings. In order to connect to a service on
your tailnet, your machine has to have the right private key. This
can let you construct an identity factor for authentication.
nginx-auth and
[proxy-to-grafana](https://tailscale.com/blog/grafana-auth/) build on
top of this idea, and that becomes a fundamental building block for
future work. In one of my own personal projects, I've been able to rip
out over 150 lines of boring authentication code because it was
handled for me with Tailscale.

I made a measurable _impact_ with my work and it helped to spread the
word about Tailscale and it's still paying dividends to this day. The
Steam Deck article gets mentioned _in sales calls_. I cannot think of
a better measure of success than that.

In late 2022 I hit a point where there was enough work to be done that
I wasn't able to keep up with it. I was writing, hacking, and
advocating nonstop and I really needed people to help me. This ended
up with the DevRel team getting formed and my teammates have been a
blessing, even before things have gotten up to full speed.

  At some point in 2022 I ended up coming up with the joke job title of "Archmage of Infrastructure"
  with the intent that I would give people a different answer every time they asked for it. For some
  reason or another, the Archmage title stuck and now I'm the first Archmage at Tailscale. My life
  is great.

In the process of doing this, I also had a unique opportunity to
weaponize something that had previously been a horrible vice: my
tendency to hyperfocus on things. This tendency has been my savior and
my jailor for most of my professional career. The most horrible part
about it is that I don't have control over what it focuses on. It's
like [an itch](https://xeiaso.net/blog/the-itch-2020-10-11) that you
can't ignore because you feel absolutely compelled to scratch and not
scratching it physically hurts or can be impossible. It's great when
it focuses on something that is "good" to focus on (such as the
project I was assigned to), but it was horrific when it focused on
something that was "bad" to focus on (such as literally anything else
but the project I was assigned to). This has both saved my ass and
gotten me into trouble countless times. It's why I've had such a rocky
career.

Working in DevRel has offered me a chance to be able to weaponize this
hyperfocus to help meet the needs. I have a few projects going on at
once that I peck at as reality demands. This gives me the ability to
wield my hyperfocus to meet my needs rather than being happy when it
meets the needs of my employer.

This gives me the freedom to focus when I can and to not focus when I
can't. This is an unparalleled level of inclusivity I have never had
at any company I have ever worked at and this should be the standard.
The DevRel team has grown from a single person doing things on the
side into a team and I want to use this opportunity to help create the
kind of team that I want to work for. I want to help create a culture
where things like hyperfocus are seen as _assets_ instead of
sometimes-useful impediments. I want the DevRel team to be a viral
force of good, and I feel that one of the ways to start that process
is to create the kind of team culture that shows their morals rather
than just writing them on a sheet of paper and saying "hi these things
exist, please believe us uwu". Actions speak louder than words. I feel
that this should be DevRel at Tailscale and I am going to do my best
to help make that happen.
