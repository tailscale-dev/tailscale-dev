summary: 'In which I liberate a robot vacuum cleaner from the cloud, and run Tailscale on it.'

If you came here because of the clickbait title: I got Tailscale running on my
robot vacuum cleaner. Get it? Because vacuum cleaners suck. Sorry, it was too
good to pass up. But read on for the full story!

So, we have cats. They're excellent cats, but they also shed a lot of hair,
which requires more frequent vacuuming. This was my excuse for buying a robot
vacuum cleaner, but really it's just neat technology and I wanted to play with one.

I haven't paid attention to the robot vacuum cleaner space since the original
Roombas from the mid-2000s. They've come a long way since then! The entry level
ones still follow the classic strategy of taking a random drive through your
space, turning whenever they bump into things, and hope that after enough random
wandering the entire floor will have been covered. But if you step up a little
to the mid- and high-end of the market, the robots come absolutely packed with
sensors and smarts!

The robot I got, a Dreametech Z10 Pro, is fairly typical of this mid-range
offering. It has a lidar sensor tower, which it uses to construct a map of your
home and navigate intelligently around it (no more random walks!). It has front
and side-facing lasers, sonars and cameras to avoid obstacles and get close to
things without touching them. And all that is powered by a quad-core Cortex A-53
SoC that was specifically designed with vacuum cleaners in mind. That's right,
robot vacuums are big enough business that SoC manufacturers are designing chips
tailored for them!

    apertures, and an IR camera cluster in the center uses distortion in the beam to sense
    obstacles.

However, the modern crop of robot vacuums are also firmly IoT cloud devices.
They connect to a faraway control plane, you get a mobile app (with a ton of
lag, since every button press is bouncing through the cloud and back to the
bot), and the machine is a completely opaque appliance. You bought it, but as
far as the robot is concerned, you're just a guest in its brain, invited there
by its makers.

The Z10 Pro is part of the [Xiaomi Smart Home][mi-home] ecosystem, one of the
world's largest IoT clouds. Unfortunately, this ecosystem's empirical security
and privacy posture is not something I'm comfortable having in my home: as
illustrated in a [DEFCON talk][giese-talk] a few years ago, the manufacturers
have effectively unlimited control over their robots in the field, up to and
including spawning a remote shell and uploading raw sensor imagery. Clouds don't
_have_ to be this invasive, but that's the reality for this robot.

And really, for this application, the cloud is just getting in the way. I wish I
could just control the robot directly somehow. And guess what, there is a way!
Let's jailbreak my vacuum cleaner.

</figure>

Before we continue, I want to give credit and praise to [Dennis
Giese][giese-site] and [Sören Beye][beye-site] for making all this possible.
Dennis has been researching the security of IoT systems for years, and has
compiled an encyclopedia of methods and expertise on gaining access to these
appliances. Sören built on top of this work and created [Valetudo][valetudo].
Valetudo is an open-source control plane for vacuum robots that runs on the
robot itself and enables cloud-free operation, as well as integration into
open-source automation ecosystems like [Home Assistant][hass].

## Jailbreaking a vacuum cleaner

I'm going to repeat the words of warning on Valetudo's website: jailbreaking
your vacuum can be fun and isn't _too_ difficult, but you need to take your
time, read and follow the instructions carefully, and accept that you could
brick your robot. This is necessarily somewhat of a messy process, so please be
aware of the risks, take your time, read the documentation, and don't take it
out on the open-source maintainers (or me) if it goes wrong.

The exact process for getting a shell on a robot vacuum varies between
manufacturers and models, and also over time because manufacturers tend to patch
the entrypoints as they become aware of them. In my case, the Z10 Pro is on
Valetudo's "recommended" list, because (at time of writing) the procedure is
quite straightforward and reliable. Let's go!

First, we need to get access to the robot's debugging port. Dreametech have a
handy connector on all their robots that collects all the system's debugging
busses and pins in one place. We're looking for the system's serial port.

The debug connector is located under a decorative panel on the top. Normally,
you would use plastic spudgers and wedges like the ones in an [iFixit
kit][ifixit] (#NotSponsored, I just like it) to gently apply leverage and pop
the clips holding that panel in place. However, I've just moved and I don't know
where my iFixit kit is, so instead I did it the wrong way.

<figure className="float-none text-center sm:pl-4">

  />
  <figcaption>
    This works, but try to avoid it, the metal screwdriver chews up the plastic as you pry.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

It took a worrying amount of force to get the panel clips to pop off, but
eventually they come free, and we're greeted with... mostly more plastic as
we've uncovered the robot's inner frame, but peeking through a hole in that
frame is a small 2x8 connector. That's our debug port!

Oh by the way, you probably want the vacuum powered off for all this.

<figure className="float-none text-center sm:pl-4">

    alt="Close up of the top of the Z10 robot, under the trim panel we just removed. An arrow points to a small connector peeking through a gap in the frame."
  />
  <figcaption>
    I love hidden ports, it's like that feeling when you mashed the spacebar against walls in Doom
    and found a secret!
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Anyway, now that we have access to the debug port, we need to hook into the
robot's serial console. I won't try to explain which pins of the connector you
should hook up to, [Valetudo's installation guide][valetudo-install] has a great
illustration for that, as well as additional wisdom and warnings. Connecting
things incorrectly on this debug port is one of the easy ways to fry your bot,
so take care.

Speaking of connecting thing, we're going to need a serial interface so that our
computer can talk to the robot. I used a [Bus Pirate][bus-pirate], an excellent
open-source communication multitool that can do (among other things) 3.3V UART,
which is what we need. I connected the bus pirate to my computer, configured it
as a transparent UART bridge, and hooked it up to the robot's serial pins.

<figure className="float-none text-center sm:pl-4">
  <Image
    src="/images/tailscale-sucks/z10-serial.jpg"
    width="461"
    height="400"
    alt="Photo of the Z10 robot, with the Bus Pirate circuit board sitting on top of it and three wires going from the Bus Pirate to the robot's debug port."
  />
  <figcaption>
    The debug port has a 2mm pitch, and my hookup wire has 2.54mm connectors, so it takes a little
    violence to make it fit. I recommend being less bad at this than me.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Finally, I powered on the robot, and... Success! The serial console lights up
with kernel logs as the SoC boots up. With a little more fiddling which I'll
gloss over (see [Valetudo's docs][valetudo-install]), I have a root shell on the
robot's OS, which as it turns out is an OpenWRT fork.

From here, it's a simple matter of backing up irreplaceable files (private keys,
device IDs, sensor calibration data from the factory), and installing a patched
firmware that breaks the cloud connection. A little NAND flashing and rebooting
later, and my robot is now a standalone system, with an SSH server, and Valetudo
providing a replacement for the vendor app's functionality!

  <figcaption>
    Valetudo is so much more responsive than the manufacturer's app, it's not even funny. Turns out,
    computers are fast when you don't send every request via the cloud!
  </figcaption>
</figure>

At this point, my robot can do everything that it could do on stock firmware,
with no cloud tethering. Well... Almost everything. Valetudo is serving its
control API and web UI over HTTP on my LAN, which is fine, but I'd prefer to
have some form of secure access. For all its downsides, the cloud connection did
provide that, whereas now we're stuck with HTTP over local network. Or are we?

## Getting Tailscale on the robot

Having done all this legwork, the robot is now a stripped down linux computer
that I control. That means I should be able to get Tailscale running on it, and
give myself a secure way to access Valetudo, and for Valetudo to dial out to my
home automation stack.

SSHing into the robot, we find a barebones linux OS, consisting mostly of
busybox and a few addon binaries. Most of the filesystem is a read-only
SquashFS, but we can write to `/tmp` which is discarded on reboot, or `/data`
which is persisted across reboots and firmware updates. One wrinkle is that the
firmware doesn't ship `iptables` (and the kernel doesn't have nftables compiled
in), so we'll have to run tailscale in [userspace networking mode][ts-user].
That's probably for the best anyway, as I feel more comfortable leaving the OS
network stack and DNS config alone on such an esoteric platform.

The robot has a generous 240MiB free space in /data, so we can be a bit lazy and
just grab static arm64 Tailscale binaries from [the package server][pkgs] and
use those. They are not optimized for size, so we'll end up eating about 40MiB
of the free space. If you want to be more economical, you can build a [stripped
down multicall binary][ts-small] from [Tailscale's source code repo][ts-source],
by running:

```
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 ./build_dist.sh \
  --extra-small --box \
  tailscale.com/cmd/tailscaled
```

The resulting binary is both the tailscale daemon and CLI. To access the latter,
create a symlink called `tailscale` that points to the tailscaled binary. This
approximately halves the storage required, at 19.6MiB.

If you downloaded the tarball straight to the robot, things are easy, just
unpack it (I suggest using `/tmp` as a staging area) and move `tailscale` and
`tailscaled` to `/data`. If you built your own, you might encounter a problem
when you try to scp the binaries to the robot:

```
$ scp tailscaled root@192.168.1.100:
sh: /usr/libexec/sftp-server: not found
scp: Connection closed
```

Whoops. The robot's firmware doesn't ship the SFTP server helper binary, and my
desktop's modern SSH client [no longer supports the legacy SCP wire
protocol][scp]. So, I can't scp or sftp binaries over. Thankfully, we can do
something gross instead:

```
cat tailscaled | ssh root@192.168.1.100 'cat >/tmp/tailscaled'
```

This won't preserve file modes, so you'll have to ssh in and `chmod +x
/tmp/tailscaled`, but other than that this works fine.

Now that we have `/data/tailscaled` and `/data/tailscale` in place, let's get
tailscaled running on boot. You can do this by editing
`/data/_root_postboot.sh`, and adding the following at the bottom:

```
if [[ -f /data/tailscaled ]]; then
	mkdir -p /data/tailscale-state /tmp/tailscale
	STATE_DIRECTORY=/tmp/tailscale /data/tailscaled \
      --tun=userspace-networking \
      --socket=/tmp/tailscale/tailscaled.sock \
      --statedir=/data/tailscale-state > /dev/null 2>&1 &
fi
```

This will start tailscaled on boot, and place its persistent data (private keys,
network maps, etc.) in `/data/tailscale-state`. Non-persistent data such as log
files and unix sockets go into `/tmp/tailscale`, to minimize the amount of
writing to flash.

At this point, you can type `reboot` and see if the robot comes back online.
Note that it occasionally likes to change IP addresses if you're using DHCP and
haven't assigned it a static IP, in which case you can use mdns to find it again
(see `avahi-browse` on linux). Or, as a last resort, reconnect the serial
console and use the root shell there to figure it out. I definitely didn't have
to do that after losing the robot on reboot and panicking that I'd bricked it,
no siree.

Now that tailscaled's running on boot, we can authenticate it as usual, or
mostly as usual:

```
/data/tailscale --socket=/tmp/tailscale/tailscaled.sock \
  up --ssh --hostname=ton618
```

You probably want to set a hostname, otherwise you'll get the OS's default
`p2028-release`. And it's a good idea to enable Tailscale SSH, because remember
the problems I had with scp/sftp earlier? Well, Tailscale SSH embeds its own
SFTP server in tailscaled, so by using it I can copy files again!

Run through the authentication dance as usual, perhaps throw in a [tag][ts-tag]
or two from the admin panel so that you can control the robot's network
permissions more finely, and voila, one robot running Tailscale!

    Now you can SSH into your robot vacuum cleaner from anywhere! The future is weird.

## Locking down Valetudo

We're almost there, but recall that originally my goal was to limit access to
the Valetudo API and webapp. I don't want random stuff on my LAN (say, other
IoT devices I don't entirely trust) to be able to poke at my vacuum cleaner. I
want Valetudo to only be accessible over Tailscale, although I'll leave the
native SSH server accessible to the LAN.

On a normal linux system, I'd just use `iptables` to firewall off port 80, and
be happy. But earlier, I discovered that iptables isn't present on the system. I
tried for a while to make it work with a static iptables binary, but iptables
refused to function because `/run` didn't exist, and I can't create `/run`
because `/` is a squashfs, and even if I could I don't even know if netfilter is
compiled into the kernel.

So, instead, let's take advantage of the fact that Valetudo is open-source! It's
a nodejs application, and it already includes some IP allowlisting code to only
allow access to LAN IPs. This is intended as a protection against people
accidentally (or deliberately!) exposing their robot to the public internet.

With Tailscale running in userspace mode, incoming connections to port 80 are
proxied by tailscaled to port 80 on localhost. So, all I need to do is go into
Valetudo's source code, edit the IP check to only permit localhost, and rebuild
and deploy my modified binary.

At some point I would like to try and upstream this change to Valetudo, but
obviously it's not suitable for upstreaming in its current form. Perhaps a
configurable IP allowlist makes sense? It's not clear to me if it's worth
complicating Valetudo's UX for this, when it's quite simple for people who care
to deploy a patched instance themselves. Valetudo's documentation is very good,
with zero nodejs experience it took me less than 30 minutes to make the change
and build my patched copy. If you'd like to do the same, here's the [patch to
lock down access to localhost only][valetudo-patch].

Plaintext HTTP over Tailscale is perfectly secure, since the traffic runs over
WireGuard, but if you want to stop browsers and picky clients from complaining
about the lack of HTTPS, it's also quite easy to throw in some TLS termination:

```
/data/tailscale --socket=/tmp/tailscale/tailscaled.sock \
  serve https:443 / http://127.0.0.1:80
```

The Tailscale daemon will fetch a TLS cert from [Let's Encrypt][le], terminate
TLS on the robot, and reverse-proxy to Valetudo on localhost:80. I haven't
bothered doing this yet, because I'm happy with just HTTP, but it's nice to know
that the option is there if I want it later.

## But Tailscale is a cloud!!1

At this point I suspect some readers are thinking that I've just replaced one
cloud connection with another. I liberated my robot, but then I reattached it to
Tailscale's control plane.

And yes, that's true to some degree, but [there are significant
differences][ts-security]. Tailscale acts as a coordinator to help your own
devices talk to each other directly, but all the communication happens over
peer-to-peer WireGuard tunnels that Tailscale-the-company can't see into. The
client's source code is open source, so you can verify that yourself.

Tailscale's control plane is not load-bearing for connectivity. If Tailscale's
servers go down, your vacuum will keep working just fine, as will connectivity
to the vacuum. So, for example, your home automation system won't lose access to
the robot if this happens.

Even though Tailscale-the-company doesn't want to see your data, the cloud
control plane is a point of attack that could inject new devices into your
tailnet. This would be highly visible and not a very sneaky attack method, but
if you're worried about that, you can use [tailnet lock][tailnet-lock] to remove
Tailscale's control plane from the trust envelope: new devices cannot join your
network without a countersignature from an existing device, using a PKI that is
separate from the Tailscale control plane.

Perhaps you don't like that Tailscale only has OAuth sign-in, which requires you
to use a Gmail, Microsoft, or GitHub account for auth (we support other
providers too, but they're paid services so even less likely to be interesting
to enthusiasts). That's fair, and we built [custom OIDC support][ts-oidc] so
that you can bring your own auth stack if you prefer.

And if you really cannot stand having a cloud involved in your vacuum robot at
all, I understand. Given the track record of the SaaS/cloud industry, it's hard
to trust anyone! In that case, [Headscale][headscale] is an open-source
implementation of the Tailscale control plane that you can self-host, and cut
Tailscale-the-company out of the loop entirely while still getting the benefits
of secure connectivity and NAT-busting remote access.

## Conclusion

So, what did we learn here? Well, I learned that jailbreaking vacuum cleaners
feels great. I learned that Dennis Giese and Sören Beye are amazing people, and
I'm grateful that they choose to share their knowledge and expertise with the
world. I learned a whole lot about the state of IoT (remember the "S" in "IoT"
stands for "security"), and the fascinating world of consumer robotics.

And perhaps most importantly, I learned that if I blog about putting Tailscale
on weird unusual devices, I can get Tailscale to reimburse me for the device.
And that's a dangerous precedent to set.
