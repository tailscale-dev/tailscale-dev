We recently released
[Tailscale Funnel](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/tailscale-funnel/)
for testing, which lets you expose a locally running web server to the internet.

Funnal can be especially useful when you are hosting services in a homelab, or
developing against webhook APIs that need to POST back to your server.
The standard way to use Funnel is to install Tailscale, run your server
on localhost, and then configure Funnel to share that server.

Today we are adding another way to use Funnel: compile it into your program.
No need to install a separate Tailscale on the host.

The open source Go
[tsnet package](https://pkg.go.dev/tailscale.com@main/tsnet)
has gained a new method: `ListenFunnel`. Call one function and you get a
`net.Listener` with a publicly reachable domain name and a valid
TLS certificate. Using it looks like this:

```go
s := &tsnet.Server{ Hostname: "fun" }
defer s.Close()

ln, err := s.ListenFunnel("tcp", ":443") // does TLS
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
defer ln.Close()

h := http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Fprintln(w, "<html>Hello from Funnel!")
})

log.Fatal(http.Serve(ln, h))
```

See the full example on GitHub in
[tsnet-funnel.go](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/blob/main/tsnet/example/tsnet-funnel/tsnet-funnel.go).

After enabling HTTPS and Funnel in the Tailscale admin panel,
you can generate an
[auth key](https://tailscale.com/kb/1085/auth-keys/)
and use it to run run this example:

```sh
TS_AUTHKEY=<your-key> go run ./tsnet-funnel.go
```

Your local web server is now available on the internet under your
[tailnet name](https://tailscale.com/kb/1217/tailnet-name/#fun-tailnet-name) at
`https://fun.<your-fun-name>.ts.net`.
