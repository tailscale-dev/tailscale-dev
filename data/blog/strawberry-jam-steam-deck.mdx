Last year I released a tutorial for how you can run [Tailscale on the
Steam Deck](https://tailscale.com/blog/steam-deck/). This article
continues to be widely referenced across the internet as people have
found new and interesting ways to use Tailscale in new and interesting
ways. Today, I wanted to show you some new and interesting ways that
we've figured out how to use Tailscale so we can inspire you to do
even more fun things.

First, let's take a little step back and look over the moving parts.
Tailscale recently introduced [Tailscale
SSH](https://tailscale.com/tailscale-ssh/), which allows you to use
Tailscale to authenticate to your devices over SSH instead of having
to rely on passwords, key rotation, copying over authorized keys and
more. When you run Tailscale on the Steam Deck, you can use Tailscale
SSH to connect to and manage your Steam Deck like any other Linux
system. One of the things you can do is copy over files with `scp` and
run downloaded programs with the shell.

With Tailscale SSH, you can make installing modifications ("mods") to
games like [Celeste](https://www.celestegame.com/) a lot easier.
Celeste is an action-platformer game where you play as pride month
icon Madeline and you work your way up Mt. Celeste as you conquer
Madeline's anxieties. It's widely regarded as one of the best
platformer games ever made and has made many innovations that have
spilled over into the rest of the industry. When games get to be that
big, the main thing that keeps them big is the underground scene of
modders that find new and exciting ways to use mechanics. Then
sometimes they all get together and produce things that the original
developers would never have thought was possible. This has happened to
Celeste and it's brought us the [Strawberry Jam
Collab](https://gamebanana.com/mods/424541).

This mod won't work on consoles because you can't modify console
games\* once they are installed on the target hardware, but remember:
the Steam Deck is just a Linux PC. You can mod PC games. Therefore,
you can run Strawberry Jam on your Steam deck. Today I'm going to show
you a practical use of Tailscale SSH: copying files and running
commands on your Steam Deck so that you can mod your games on the go.

  \*Okay, okay, technically you _can_ modify console games, but it's generally something that's very
  unsupported, is regularly broken by updates on the console manufacturer side, and runs the risk of
  getting you banned from online services in a day and age where consoles are shipping without disc
  drives. Let's just pretend that you can't mod the console version of Celeste because the mod
  manager doesn't run on consoles.

## Prerequisites

To follow along at home, you'll need to have the following things:

- A Steam Deck or another device running SteamOS or
  [HoloISO](https://github.com/HoloISO/holoiso) (Anbernic Win600, ROG
  Ally, GPD devices, etc).
- A copy of Celeste from
  [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/), or
  [itch.io](https://mattmakesgames.itch.io/celeste).
- A free [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) account.
- A desktop or laptop computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- [The Strawberry Jam mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/424541)
  downloaded from Gamebanana to your computer.

The first step is going to be purchasing and downloading Celeste from
your storefront of choice. I have tested this article against both the
Steam and Itch versions of Celeste. Once it's downloaded, launch the
game once, get past the tutorial, and then close it. This will set
everything up so that the mods can load correctly, and it proves that
the game works at all.

Next, switch to the desktop by opening the Steam menu with the Steam
button, going down to "Power" at the bottom, and then selecting
"Switch to Desktop". This will open [KDE](https://kde.org/), the
default desktop environment on SteamOS. Once that is open, download
[tailscale.sh](https://gist.github.com/legowerewolf/1b1670457cfac9201ee9d67840952147)
to a USB flash drive and copy it over to your Steam Deck, ideally in
your home directory. You can also get it there by opening Firefox,
searching for "legowerewolf Tailscale install Gist" and clicking on
the link. Open the terminal program Konsole by going to Start ->
System -> Konsole. When in the terminal program, you can press Steam+X
to bring up an on-screen keyboard.

If you don't have a sudo password set up yet, run the `passwd` command
to set one. Any password is fine, even something as simple as
`hunter2`. We won't be exposing your Deck's SSH port to the local
network or using OpenSSH to get access, so the password should ideally
be easy to type with the dual touchpads.

Run the tailscale installer script with `sudo bash ./tailscale.sh` and
let it think for a moment. Once it's done, maximize your terminal and
run this command:

```
tailscale up --ssh --qr
```

This will generate a QR code that you can scan with your phone to
authenticate you to your tailnet. Follow the normal process to join
your Deck to your tailnet, and then you should be able to connect to
it over SSH on your other computer. Your phone should show you the
name of the device in the authentication flow, but it is `steamdeck`
by default. You can change the hostname in the settings screen of game
mode.

```
ssh deck@steamdeck
```

This will make things a lot easier.

## Modding Celeste

Now that we have shell access to your Deck, let's start modding
Celeste. We will need to do the following things:

- Download and install Olympus, the mod manager for Celeste
- Use Olympus to install Everest, the mod runtime for Celeste
- Install the Strawberry Jam mod

Olympus can be downloaded from [the Celeste Mod Loader
website](https://everestapi.github.io/#installing-everest). Download
the .zip for Linux systems and unzip the first archive. The second
archive is what you will need on your Deck. Run these commands on your
computer:

```
unzip linux.main.zip
scp dist.zip deck@steamdeck:Downloads/Olympus.zip
```

Then go back into your Deck over SSH, extract and install the Olympus
installer:

```
ssh deck@steamdeck
cd Downloads
mkdir olympus
cd olympus
unzip ../Olympus.zip
./install.sh
```

This will unzip olympus into its own folder and install it, setting up
the launcher file and the URL handlers so that you can install the
mod.

Open Olympus with Start -> Games -> Olympus. Hit the "manage" button
to select your Celeste install. It should be automatically detected.
Then install the stable version of Everest. Once you are done, close
Olympus and copy the Strawberry Jam file you downloaded to
`/home/deck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Celeste/Mods` with
scp:

```
scp strawberryjammappack_v108.zip deck@steamdeck:/home/deck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Celeste/Mods
```

This will take a moment, but when it's done you can go back into game
mode with the icon on your desktop and start Celeste. The mod loader
will complain about missing dependencies. Let it do its thing and you
should end up with Celeste modded to heck and back! You'll have to
select the Strawberry Jam mod in the bottom of the file creation
screen.

Tailscale SSH made the installation of these mods so much simpler. You
didn't need to type out complicated commands on the Deck. All you
needed to do was SSH in, copy files over, and then you're off to the
strawberry races.
