You can simplify the entire philosophical field of
[metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics) (the kind
where you study the fundamental natures of reality, not the kind with
The Spoop™️) to answering the following two questions in as much detail
as possible:

- What is there?
- What is it like?

There's many conflicting theories as to how you do this and overall
every major group has their own views as to how to answer these two
questions using complicated concepts like "postulate" and
"invalidate".

In the same way, you can simplify the entire process of authentication
(the kind where you study the fundamental natures of who is on the
other side of the connection, not the kind with acronym soup and
buzzwords) to the following two questions:

- Where is the user coming from?
- Is the user the same person as the last time?

There's many conflicting theories as to how you do this and overall
every major group has their own views as to how to answer these
questions using complicated concepts like "cryptographic signatures"
and "identity management".

There has to be an easier way, right? What if it was just as easy as
reading HTTP headers?

## Identity over Tailscale: the classic approach

However, with Tailscale's authenticated and identity validated peer to
peer WireGuard mesh network we can throw all that out and replace the
authentication process with these simple steps:

- Have your application listen over Tailscale
- Do a [WhoIs localapi
  lookup](https://pkg.go.dev/tailscale.com@v1.46.1/client/tailscale#LocalClient.WhoIs)
  on every incoming request
- Annotate requests with that and use it to derive permissions, audit
  log entries, or whatever

In essence, the native Tailscale way to do authentication is to use
Tailscale as an authentication service. This is fine, and it works
well enough that we use it in production for internal dashboards,
audit log entries, and other fun things like that.

<Warning>
  This does not include authorization logic. That should always be a separate step done by other
  two-factor auth challenges.
</Warning>

The key takeaway here is that using the Tailscale Serve identity
headers is infinitely more easy than poking the WhoIs localapi route
directly. I have a few things on my home network that do
authentication "the old way" that I am going to need to adapt to this
brave new Tailscale future. Now if only I had the time to do this.

However, it's very easy to mess things up by forgetting to make the
WhoIs request. This also means that if your service needs to pass
authentication credentials down the line for some reason, you need to
remember to annotate the requests with Tailscale information, and
overall it's kind of a mess that's easy to screw up.

  Code you don't write is code you can't forget to write.
</div>

Not to mention the WhoIs API call is presented as a HTTP server
listening to a UNIX socket. UNIX sockets are like normal network
sockets, but instead of Internet Protocol addresses as targets, they
use special entries in the filesystem called sockets. In order to make
that WhoIs call, your language of choice has to have an HTTP client
that is able to connect to UNIX sockets. This works fine in Go
(because the standard library HTTP client is basically infinitely
hackable due to some clever API design), but not out of the box in
Ruby, Node, Deno, Python, and Rust.

So this does work, but it's language-dependent and if you get unlucky
you get to pull in all of libcurl to make a single HTTP request to a
single UNIX socket and then have to live with having multiple HTTP
clients linked into your app.

## Tailscale as a middleware

At the moment you probably view Tailscale as a networking layer for
your applications because it is a networking product. Let's think
about it another way. Let's think about Tailscale as a middleware for
your applications that decorates requests with identity information so
that you can protect your internal tooling. This is a very subtle
change, but fully grokking this has fundamentally changed the way I
look at Tailscale.

<div className="border-l-2 border-gray-300 text-xl font-semibold bg-gray-200 pb-[1.5ex] pt-0.5 px-4 text-gray-900 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-gray-50 md:max-w-lg">
  Any language with an HTTP server can read information out of HTTP headers. Not every language with
  an HTTP client can connect to a UNIX socket.
</div>

When Tailscale added [HTTP identity
headers](https://tailscale.dev/blog/id-headers-tailscale-serve-flask)
recently, this means that Tailscale can be your _middleware_. This
makes it impossible to forget or mess up. This obsoleted a bunch of my
public and private code. However, the biggest one was a tool
imaginatively called `proxy-to-grafana`.

## proxy-to-grafana

Last year Will and I collaborated on a tool called
`proxy-to-grafana`, it lets you have Grafana use Tailscale as
its authentication mechanism. This was originally intended to be one
of the first examples of how tsnet could be used in new and
interesting ways: to let you make services [_part of your
tailnet_](https://tailscale.dev/blog/tsup-tsnet) instead of just things
that live adjacent to it. It was effectively an adaptor between tsnet,
Go's standard library HTTP server, Tailscale identity data, and Go's
standard library HTTP reverse proxy along with instructions on how to
use this with Grafana.

Here's how to obviate `proxy-to-grafana` with Tailscale Serve:

First, install Grafana [like
normal](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-secure-grafana-on-ubuntu-20-04),
and then edit the `/etc/grafana/grafana.ini` with the following block
of data:

```ini
[auth.proxy]
enabled = true
header_name = Tailscale-User-Login
header_property = username
auto_sign_up = true
sync_ttl = 60
whitelist = 127.0.0.1
headers = Email:Tailscale-User-Login, Name:Tailscale-User-Name
enable_login_token = true
```

Then enable Tailscale serve with this command:

```
tailscale serve https:443 / http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

After doing that and restarting Grafana, follow the rest of the steps
[in the original
article](https://tailscale.com/blog/grafana-auth/#locking-down-grafana)
to lock down and harden Grafana. Please note that you will want to
access your Grafana installation over Tailscale Serve at least once
and then promote that user to admin via the raw HTTP port before you
fully lock down Grafana. You may want to do the following pivot
process:

- Enable auth proxy support in Grafana
- Restart Grafana
- Access Grafana over Tailscale Serve
- Disable auth proxy support in Grafana
- Log in as admin
- Promote your other user to admin
- Enable auth proxy support in Grafana
- Restart Grafana

If you don't do this, you have a good chance of accidentally locking
yourself out of your Grafana server. This may not be convenient in
many configurations and can be annoying to recover from. It will
require some SQLite hacking and overall it's just easier to do it the
way I spelled out.

<XesiteConv name="Aoi" mood="wut">
  Okay, you've sold me. What's the catch though? This sounds a bit too good to be true. Surely
  there's some things that still need you to do authentication the old way.
</XesiteConv>

<ConvSnippet authors={props.authorDetails} name="Xe Iaso">
  Yep, if you use a tsnet app, you'll need to do things the "old way". I'm sure that it could be
  done as a middleware at the tsnet level, but for right now the main way you can read this is to
  use the `tailscale serve` command, which also currently limits you to a single HTTPS service on
  port 443. You can listen on other ports though, it just becomes increasingly less magic as you do
  this. This is a known issue across Tailscale and something that we really need to fix for once and
  for all.
</ConvSnippet>

With all this in mind, let's go back to those questions I asked at the
beginning of the article.

- **Where is the user coming from?**<br />The user is coming from your
  tailnet because Tailscale uses a peer-to-peer WireGuard mesh.
- **How do you know it's the same user as last time?**<br />Tailscale
  tells you who that user is because Tailscale already knows who you
  are.
