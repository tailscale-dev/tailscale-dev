Imagine this scenario: you're setting up that Raspberry Pi you were
finally able to get your hands on after years of them being literal
unobtanium, you look at the device, and then at your cables in pure
despair. The Raspberry Pi 4 has two HDMI ports, but they're not normal
HDMI. They're micro-HDMI and you don't have adaptors. Oh, you can
figure out the IP address in your DHCP table, and then you could go
through and connect over SSH, get told you need to change your
password, get kicked out, and then reconnect. Then you can get around
to installing Tailscale or whatever.

This does work, but it is insufficiently magic for our needs. What if
you could just turn your Pi on and have it magically appear on your
tailnet? Keep reading, because that's exactly what we're gonna cover
today: grafting Tailscale into your Raspberry Pi with the magic of the
cloud.

## Setup

So let's put all this together. First you need to download a few
things:

- Ubuntu Server for the Raspberry Pi:
  https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi
- Etcher to burn the image to your SD card: https://etcher.balena.io/

Then open Etcher and load the Ubuntu image. Select your SD card as the
target and then hit the "Flash!" button. After entering your sudo
password, let it cook. It may take up to 15 minutes depending on the
grade of flash in your card, how your SD card reader connects to your
computer, and the current phase of the moon.

Once that's done, eject the SD card and plug it back in. In Finder,
you should see a volume called `system-boot` that has a file named
`user-data` in it. Now download the `tailgraft.py` script [from
GitHub](https://github.com/tailscale-dev/tailgraft) and put it in your
Downloads folder. Then open a terminal window and run `tailgraft.py`
as root:

```
sudo python3 tailgraft.py
```

  <summary>Windows users</summary>

If you're running this on Windows, your best bet is going to be

</details>

It'll ask you a few questions, but be sure to give it an
[authkey](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys) so that
your Pi can join your tailnet on boot. This is a place where having
[ACL tags](https://tailscale.com/kb/1068/acl-tags/) can be useful,
especially if you tag it with something like `tag:exit` so that you
can limit access to it.

When it's done, eject your SD card and plug your Pi into ethernet and
power. It will take a while to boot and converge (usually 15 minutes
at most), but when it's done it will show up in your tailnet.

Now for the real magic, you can directly SSH into it without a
password using [Tailscale SSH](https://tailscale.com/tailscale-ssh/).
If your Pi is named `mincemeat`, you can run this command:

```
ssh ubuntu@mincemeat
```

No passwords or keys required! You can do whatever you like from here
from setting up [Tailscale
Serve](https://tailscale.com/kb/1242/tailscale-serve/) to point to a
local [Gitea](https://gitea.io) install, setting up an internal wiki,
or anything you can imagine. You can even expose things to the public
internet with [Funnel](https://tailscale.dev/blog/funnel-101).

<ConvSnippet authors={props.authorDetails} name="Xe Iaso">
  If you chose to make your Pi an exit node, you will need to [confirm that in the admin
  console](https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes/#step-2-allow-the-exit-node-from-the-admin-console).
  Once you've done that, you can enable the exit node in the Tailscale menulet, system tray icon, or
  in the app.

## How it works

Now that you have your Pi set up, let's take a moment to learn how
this all works and why I said it's using the magic of the cloud.

When you set up an instance in AWS or a droplet in Digital Ocean, you
don't usually just get dumped a username and password and told "good
luck". There's ways to pre-load SSH keys and other configuration via
the "user data" field. This allows you to use everyone's favorite
configuration language to tell the platform how it should mangle the
base image to your needs: YAML. This is powered by
[cloud-init](https://cloud-init.io/), a tragically under-documented
critical part of the modern internet.

Now you may be wondering something like:

<XesiteConv name="Aoi" mood="wut">
  Okay, wait. You just said that we're going to be using Ubuntu on a Raspberry Pi in order to do
  this. How is the cloud relevant?
</XesiteConv>

It's relevant beacuse the Ubuntu Raspberry Pi images ships with
cloud-init! This lets you steal the YAML fire from the cloud gods so
that you can assimilate your pi into your tailnet. Not to mention,
it's actually possible to buy Raspberry Pi boards without having to
sign over your kidneys or hunting them out from scalpers like we did
with PS5s.

> "false".

### cloud-init installs Tailscale

One of the things cloud-init offers is the `runcmd` block. This allows
you to make a list of arbitrary shell commands that are run as root
some time after boot. Here's an example `runcmd` block that the shell
script makes:

```yaml
runcmd:
  - ['sh', '-c', 'curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh']
  - [
      'sh',
      '-c',
      "echo 'net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.d/99-tailscale.conf && echo 'net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 1' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.d/99-tailscale.conf && sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-tailscale.conf",
    ]
  - ['tailscale', 'up', '--ssh', '--advertise-exit-node', '--authkey=changeme', '--hostname=ubuntu']
  - ['sh', '-c', 'sudo hostnamectl hostname ubuntu']
```

This automatically installs Tailscale, enables the [sysctl settings
for IP forwarding on
Linux](https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes/#step-1-advertise-a-device-as-an-exit-node),
authenticates you to Tailscale, and sets the hostname using
[`hostnamectl`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/hostnamectl.1.html).
When your Pi boots, it will run all of these commands and this should
result in Tailscale activating on boot.

<ConvSnippet authors={props.authorDetails} name="Xe Iaso">
You can use the same basic user data commands for spinning up new Digital Ocean droplets or Google Cloud instances. cloud-init has [a lot of other functionality](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/examples.html) including:

- Pulling an Ansible playbook and running it on boot
- Installing arbitrary packages
- Creating user accounts for other people in your tailnet
- Importing SSH public keys from GitHub
- Writing arbitrary files to the disk

and even more! Feel free to experiment with this, you'll probably find something you'll love in the process.
