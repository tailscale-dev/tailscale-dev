We also cover the basics of [Tailscale SSH](https://tailscale.com/tailscale-ssh/), [MagicDNS](https://tailscale.com/kb/1081/magicdns/), unique private device IPs, and help you wrap your brain around [exit nodes](https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes/?q=exit%20). Of course, this video just scratches the surface of what's possible with Tailscale - learn more over on our [documentation](https://tailscale.com/kb/1017/install/).
