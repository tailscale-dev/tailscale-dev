summary: 'This blog uses a lot of modern technologies like MDX, Xe uses Emacs, which nobody has implemented MDX support for. In this article Xe gets MDX support working anyways through the use/abuse of directory-local variables in Emacs so you can do this too.'

I'm an [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) user and I have
been for the last decade. I use emacs for _everything_ from code, to
posts on this blog, even down to my daily TODO list with [Org
Mode](https://orgmode.org/). Naturally, I want to also use emacs to
edit posts on this blog. The only problem is that the blog uses
[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) instead of normal Markdown. There isn't an
Emacs major mode for MDX and the [ticket for editor support in MDX was
closed](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/issues/119). This should mean that I'm out of luck and must architect a new major mode for Emacs.

However, this is Emacs. You have godlike power to do anything we want
here. MDX is just Markdown with JSX, and there's [already a widely
used major mode for Markdown named
`markdown-mode`](https://melpa.org/#/markdown-mode). JSX is close
enough to HTML that realistically we don't have to care about the
details, especially in an environment where the important JSX
components are already imported into the document scope for us.

You can use all of this information to _bodge_ MDX support into Emacs
by using [directory-local
variables](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html).

Directory-local variables live in `.dir-locals.el` and will apply to
any file in the same folder as the `.dir-locals.el` file _and all of
its subfolders_. If you stick a `.dir-locals.el` file at the top level
of a project, it will apply for all the files in the project.

You can add MDX support to Emacs by changing the
[`auto-mode-alist`](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AutoModeAlist)
variable to change which major mode Emacs uses based on the filetype:

```lisp
;;; Directory Local Variables
;;; For more information see (info "(emacs) Directory Variables")

((auto-mode-alist . (("\\.mdx\\'" . markdown-mode))))
```

This will make every `.mdx` file load in markdown-mode, allowing you
to edit files like normal. It looks a bit horrible with only one
example, but the basic schema is that it's an association list (read:
hashtable) that contains variable definitions. If you also wanted to
make `markdown-mode` wrap files at 80 characters and `typescript-mode`
use two spaces for indent, you would do something like this:

```lisp
;;; Directory Local Variables
;;; For more information see (info "(emacs) Directory Variables")

((auto-mode-alist . (("\\.mdx\\'" . markdown-mode)))
 (markdown-mode . ((fill-column . 80)))
 (typescript-mode . ((typescript-indent-level . 2))))
```

Sometimes you need to do a bit more though. This lets you set
variables for buffers, but it doesn't let you _execute code_ in
buffers. The CI configuration for this repo also needs us to make sure
our MDX documents are formatted correctly, and we use
[prettier](https://prettier.io/) to take care of all of that for us.

Emacs lets you set the variable name `eval` to a block of lisp code to
run when loading buffers with that major mode. This lets you do things
like this to have `markdown-mode` auto-format files on save:

```lisp
;;; Directory Local Variables
;;; For more information see (info "(emacs) Directory Variables")

((auto-mode-alist . (("\\.mdx\\'" . markdown-mode)))
 (markdown-mode . ((fill-column . 80)
                   (eval . (prettier-js-mode 1))))
 (typescript-mode . ((typescript-indent-level . 2))))
```

This will make Emacs prompt you if you really want to do this every
time you load the file, but you can squelch this by using the `!` key.

This is all you need to get MDX working in Emacs. If you want to see
more, look at the
[`.dir-locals.el`](https://github.com/tailscale-dev/tailscale-dev/blob/main/.dir-locals.el)
in the [tailscale-dev](https://github.com/tailscale-dev/tailscale-dev)
repo.
