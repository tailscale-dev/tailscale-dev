- [**Using code-server with Tailscale on Ubuntu 20.04**](https://www.notion.so/Install-code-server-on-Ubuntu-20-04-with-Tailscale-f73cc18ed34f46ee8c94bb93ec77f288)
  @thrillifying's guide walks through using Tailscale for a secure, low-latency connection to VS Code via code-server. Connecting to remote devices for development is a common way people use Tailscale.
- [**Secure an Ubuntu server with Tailscale and UFW**](https://tailscale.com/kb/1077/secure-server-ubuntu-18-04)
  /u/mgozmovies wrote [a great tutorial on /r/Tailscale](https://old.reddit.com/r/Tailscale/comments/hwnc0l/restricting_ssh_access_to_tailscale_interface_on/) showing how to lock down a server using UFW and Tailscale. We tested and wrote it up into an official guide. For those curious, why we recommend allowing firewall access to the tailscale0 interface even though Tailscale works without it, [this twitter thread](https://mobile.twitter.com/dave_universetf/status/1288887238537838592) provides some extra context.
