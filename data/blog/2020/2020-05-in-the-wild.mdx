- [@mrkaran](https://twitter.com/mrkaran_) wrote [an article detailing how he uses Tailscale](https://mrkaran.dev/posts/home-server-updates/) to connect a VPS to a local Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster. His post walks through triaging blocked UDP packets, multiple competing overlay networks, and some DNS fiddling to make it all work.
- [@nirev](https://twitter.com/nirev) created an [open-source package builder for Synology NASs](https://github.com/nirev/synology-tailscale). It requires a manual install, but itâ€™s a great option for NAS users looking to connect over Tailscale today.
