Tailscale lets you share things with your coworkers, your family, and your
friends; but not everyone else. This allows you to set up your own [private URL
shortener](https://tailscale.com/blog/golink/) or expose a test instance of your
application to your coworkers, but sometimes you need to test your tools against
the real world. Tailscale Funnel allows you to expose your local services to
the public Internet, just like any other website.

Today I'm going to walk you through the basics of funnel and show you how to
use it with a live demo. We're going to start by creating a small service that
says hello world, and then I'm going to show you how to make it interact with
other applications on the internet, such as receiving webhooks from Tailscale.

In order to follow along, you will need the following:

- An invite to the Funnel feature preview (ask us [on
  Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@tailscale) or check the
  [thread on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tailscale/comments/105tvgo/the_funnel_invite_request_and_share_thread/)).
- A development machine running Linux, macOS, or Windows.
- [Deno](https://deno.land) installed on your development machine.

<Warning>
  Be sure [funnel is enabled in your tailnet policy
  file](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/tailscale-funnel/) for your development machine. Funnel won't
  work without it.
</Warning>

## Making the service

First, we need to generate the service scaffold for the application we're going
to make. You can use any tool you like, but for simplicity I'm going to be using
[Deno](https://deno.land) and [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev). To get started,
open a terminal on your developer machine, and run this command:

```
deno run -A -r https://fresh.deno.dev funnel-example
```

It will ask you a few questions, answer them based on your preferences. You can
replace `funnel-example` with a different name if desired.

Enter that directory with `cd`:

```
cd funnel-example
```

Then run `deno task start` to start your web service in developer mode:

```
deno task start
```

Open [the site in your browser](http://localhost:8000). By default, this will
run the service so that you can access it from your tailnet.

Now that the app is running, use `tailscale serve` to route to that port:

```
tailscale serve / proxy 8000
```

Then you can confirm it with `tailscale serve status`:

```
$ tailscale serve status
https://xe-dev-vm.shark-harmonic.ts.net (tailnet only)
|-- / proxy http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Finally, enable funnel for the machine with `tailscale serve`:

```
tailscale serve funnel on
```

Then confirm it got enabled with `tailscale serve status`:

```
$ tailscale serve status
https://xe-dev-vm.shark-harmonic.ts.net (Funnel on)
|-- / proxy http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Then take that link and link it to your friends! They'll be able to see the
changes that you make to your project as soon as you hit save. For example, open
`routes/index.tsx` in your favorite text editor and change it to look like this:

```tsx
import { Head } from '$fresh/runtime.ts';
import Counter from '../islands/Counter.tsx';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>Fresh App</title>
      </Head>
      <div class="mx-auto max-w-screen-md p-4">
        <p class="my-6">
          Hey from Funnel! This is running on a machine behind a firewall but you can still reach it
          from the Internet thanks to Funnel!
        </p>
        <Counter start={3} />
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
```

You can do anything you can with Fresh at this point. Take a look at the [Fresh
documentation](https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/introduction) for more ideas. You can
also change this to point at another service, such as a Rails app or anything
else that listens for HTTP on a network port.

This isn't just limited to webapps, you can also set up GitHub, Tailscale, or
other webhooks with this too.

## Listening for Tailscale webhooks

To wrap this up, I'm going to show you how to use this in the real world by
turning your new application into a Tailscale webhook listener. you can use
this to have custom logic run whenever something changes on your tailnet.

First, open the [webhooks page in the admin
panel](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/webhooks).

<Image
  src="/images/funnel-101/webhookui.png"
  width={831}
  height={310}
  alt="The webhook management component of the Tailscale admin console, showing an 'Add endpoint' button and no webhook endpoints configured."
/>

Click on "Add endpoint...".

<Image
  className="max-w-md"
  src="/images/funnel-101/webhookmake.png"
  width={552}
  height={921}
  alt="The 'Add endpoint' modal dialog. It has a box for the webhook URL and a list of events to fire on. All events are selected."
/>

Copy your funnel URL into the Webhook URL box and add `/api/webhooks/tailscale`
to the end of it. Enable all events.

This will give you a webhook secret. Copy this to your clipboard or a scratch
buffer/notepad window. Depending on how your organization works, you may want to
copy this value into a password manager.

<Image
  src="/images/funnel-101/webhooksecret.png"
  width={570}
  height={374}
  alt="The 'Webhook secret' modal dialog. It has a box with a webhook secret in it. There is text explaining that the webhook secret is used to sign messages from Tailscale and that you cannot view the secret again if you don't copy it right now."
/>

Go back to your IDE and create a new file called `.env`. Copy the webhook secret
into it like this (replace `tskey-webhook-hunter2hunter2hunter2` with your actual
secret):

```
TAILSCALE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=tskey-webhook-hunter2hunter2hunter2
```

Next, load this `.env` file with the [Deno standard
library](https://deno.land/std@0.178.0). Open `import_map.json` and add this
line to the end of it:

```json
{
  // the rest of the file...
  "twind/": "https://esm.sh/twind@0.16.17/",
  "std/": "https://deno.land/std@0.178.0/"
}
```

Then open `main.ts` and add this line after `manifest` is imported:

```ts
import 'std/dotenv/load.ts';
```

This will use the [dotenv](https://deno.land/std@0.178.0/dotenv/mod.ts) module
to read the `.env` file and load all values into it in the environment.

TODO(Xe): replace temporary gist with GitHub repo after Latacora reviews the code

Finally, we need to add the Tailscale webhook library to the import map. You can
do that by adding this to the end of your import map JSON file:

```json
{
  // the rest of the file
  "std/": "https://deno.land/std@0.178.0/",
  "$tswebhook": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tailscale-dev/tailscale-deno@0.0.1/webhook/mod.ts"
}
```

Next, create a new file in your routes folder:
`routes/api/webhooks/tailscale.ts`. You may have to create a folder called
webhooks. Copy the following into that file:

```ts
import { Payload, validate } from '$tswebhook';
import { HandlerContext, Handlers } from '$fresh/server.ts';

export const handler: Handlers = {
  async POST(req: Request, _ctx: HandlerContext) {
    const { ok, body } = await validate(req, Deno.env.get('TAILSCALE_WEBHOOK_SECRET') as string);
    if (!ok) {
      console.log(`remote client sent invalid request`);
      return new Response('invalid request', { status: 400 });
    }

    const msgs: Payload[] = JSON.parse(body);

    msgs.forEach((msg) => {
      console.log(`[tailscale-webhook] ${msg.message}`);
    });

    return new Response('OK', { status: 200 });
  },
};
```

This does the following:

- Creates an async handler for the `POST` method.
- Uses the `$tswebhook` library to validate incoming webhook requests, and
  if they are invalid then it responds with HTTP status code 400 (Bad
  Request).
- Parses the webhook payload to the variable `msgs`.
- Loops over all of the messages and runs custom logic (such as printing
  data to standard out) on each message.
- Responds with HTTP status 200 (OK) so that Tailscale's webhook sender
  doesn't try to resend the webhooks.

You could easily extend this to do whatever you want from here. If you
need some ideas on what you can do with this, here are couple that I
find interesting:

- Send webhook messages to other services like Slack or Discord to
  inform people about tailnet changes.
- Store these events in a database like
  [SQLite](https://deno.land/x/sqlite@v3.7.0) and show information
  in a custom UI.

We've been working a lot on funnel and different ways that you could use
it inside your production and personal environments. What other fun uses
have you found for funnel? I use it to expose the development version of
[my website](https://xeiaso.net) to people that are reviewing its articles
for grammatical and technical correctness. Let us know on the Fediverse
by mentioning [@tailscale@hachyderm.io](https://hachyderm.io/@tailscale)
with the hashtag #funnelHack!
