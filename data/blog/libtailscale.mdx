---

We just released
[libtailscale](https://github.com/tailscale/libtailscale),
an experimental Tailscale C library.
It is built atop the Go [tsnet](https://pkg.go.dev/tailscale.com/tsnet)
package which uses a userland network stack to implement TCP/IP
directly inside your process.

```c
// A tailnet echo server.
tailscale ts = tailscale_new();
if (tailscale_set_ephemeral(ts, 1)) {
	return err(ts);
}
if (tailscale_up(ts)) {
	return err(ts);
}
tailscale_listener ln;
if (tailscale_listen(ts, "tcp", ":1999", &ln)) {
	return err(ts);
}
while (1) {
	tailscale_conn conn;
	if (tailscale_accept(ln, &conn)) {
		return err(ts);
	}
	char buf[2048];
	while ((ret = read(conn, buf, sizeof(buf))) > 0) {
		write(1, buf, ret);
	}
	close(conn);
}
```

For those who have spent some time in our source code, you’ll know
Tailscale writes almost everything in Go.
So how did we end up with a C library?
It’s not widely used, but the standard Go toolchain includes all the
machinery necessary for producing a C library in the form of
[build modes](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Build_modes).

## Go Build Modes

The two key build modes are `c-archive` and `c-shared`.
The first creates an object archive that can be linked by a standard
C toolchain into a binary.
The second creates a shared object (on Linux, the .so file) that can
be dynamically linked into a binary.
They are surprisingly easy to use:

    go build -buildmode=c-archive pkg

This produces an object archive, and a generated header for the C
symbols Go exports.

As part of compilation, cgo can "export" your Go functions to C using
an `//export` directive.
This creates a symbol that can be easily called from a C program,
with cgo taking care of all the work around setting up the Go runtime
environment necessary to execute the Go code when C invokes the call.

To make it possible to `read(2)` and `write(2)` on a `tailscale_conn`,
it is one half of a `socketpair(2)`, while the other half is held by
the userspace TCP/IP implementation.

## Memory Management

Where things get interesting is dealing with managed heap memory.
Every programming language providing some form of memory safety or
management imposes (often invisible) rules on allocated heap memory.
The most dramatic are moving garbage collectors, which can pause some
fraction of a program at any moment, and move a piece of memory,
rewriting all pointers into that memory.
This is extremely common as moving GCs are very CPU-efficient for
programs that allocate a large amount of short-lived heap memory,
because they enable very efficient
[generational memory management](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection#Generational_GC_(ephemeral_GC)>).

While Go does not use a moving collector, it does specify the rules
for Go-managed memory crossing from Go to C.
Those rules are designed to allow the
[precise collector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection#Precise_vs._conservative_and_internal_pointers)
to know where all pointers to Go memory are at all times, and to allow
the Go runtime implementation to switch to a moving collector in the
future if the trade-offs ever make sense for the sorts of programs
written in Go.
The result is a set of tight restrictions on when C is allowed to hold
a pointer into Go memory.
There is also some degree of enforcement of these rules in Go runtime
checks, to help people from writing programs that might break
surprisingly in the future with changes in Go.

The full details of Go’s rules for passing pointers are in the
[cgo documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/cgo#hdr-Passing_pointers).
Two things stand out:

- _Go code may pass a Go pointer to C provided the Go memory to which it points does not contain any Go pointers._

- _C code may not keep a copy of a Go pointer after the call returns._

These are very limiting!
(Again, for good reasons, both today and in the future.)

The first rule, no pointers to pointers, means that only simple memory
can be passed from Go to C.
For example, you could pass a `*byte` pointer into a slice and have C
read out of the slice, or write into it.
That can be very useful for efficiently copying large amounts of data.
But if you have an `*http.Server` you can never pass a reference to C,
for it to then use exported functions to call methods on the object.

Combined with the second rule, it becomes effectively impossible to
implement something that looks like a socket API directly as we do
inside the Go `tsnet` package:

```
tailscale tailscale_new();
int tailscale_dial(tailscale sd, const char* network, const char* addr, tailscale_conn* conn_out);
```

So how do we do it?

## Handles

It turns out we have a really well-trod conceptual model for
interacting from C with a managed memory space: system calls.
Kernel memory is generally off-limits to userspace and needs to be
operated on through intermediary functions.
Userspace memory is accessible to the kernel, but because kernels do
not have a lot of insight into how userspace manages its memory,
passing a pointer is always done under very carefully specified conditions.

The typical way to refer to a kernel object from userspace is to be
given a handle.
The most familiar handle to a Unix user is a
[file descriptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor).
These are process-unique integers that refer to an entry table
of objects stored in the kernel.

We can do exactly the same thing for Go objects:

```
// servers tracks all the allocated *tsnet.Server objects.
var servers struct {
        mu   sync.Mutex
        next C.int
        m    map[C.int]*tsnet.Server
}
```

A Go function exported to C with `//export` can allocate a new `*tsnet.Server`,
pick a number for its handle, and return that number to C.
Whoever C wants to refer to the server it passes the number back and
Go looks it up in the map.

This lets C refer to a Go pointer, but for the pointer itself to
remain entirely managed by the Go runtime.

We use process-global maps like this for the `tailscale`,
`tailscale_listener`, and `tailscale_conn` handles.

This puts C completely in charge of freeing memory.
If the C program does not call the appropriate close function, the Go
memory will live forever in the map and not be collected.
But it is the nature of an unmanaged heap (like C has) that programmers
have to be responsible for freeing memory.

## Future work

There are two next steps for libtailscale.
The first is writing libraries in other languages on top of their
foreign function interface libraries.
At some point, in some way, _almost_ every language talks to C.
(A great counter-example is the
[WASM Tailscale client](https://tailscale.com/blog/ssh-console/)).
It should be possible to put a `tailscale.jar` file into your Java
project and start dialing and listening on your tailnet.

The second step is exposing more functionality of the Tailscale node
to both C and other languages built on top of libtailscale.
To do that we need to implement LocalAPI.
There are a few interesting lessons in using cross-language bindings
to be found there too, which should make for a nice follow-up blog post
to this one.
